Russia Today

A large-scale nuclear training exercise will take place in the US state of New York this week with visible activity expected to begin on Monday, the FBI has said.

The multi-agency training is scheduled to run from January 26 through January 31 in Schenectady, Albany, and Saratoga Counties, the agency announced. It added that the exercise poses no threat to the public.

The training will be primarily concentrated around Albany International Airport, the Stratton Air National Guard Base, and fire departments in northern Saratoga County.

The drills will simulate a nuclear event and are part of a series of regularly scheduled, biannual exercises conducted by the US government since 2012, the agency said in a statement on Friday.

â€˜I believe planning for this one began back in the spring,â€™ FBI Albany Public Affairs Officer Sarah Ruane told reporters. The drills are not being conducted in response to any recent or ongoing world events, she added.

In areas where the training will be taking place, residents may see participants wearing personal protective equipment â€˜to simulate realistic conditions,â€™ as well as the presence of military personnel, vehicles, and aircraft, the FBI said.

The exercise is intended to â€˜practice and enhance operational readiness to respond in the event of a nuclear incident in the United States or overseas,â€™ according to the agency.

â€˜This is an exercise of the National Technical Nuclear Forensics Ground Collection Task Force, which would support the investigation of a nuclear incident,â€™ Ruane said. â€˜The Task Force mission is to collect nuclear debris samples for analysis at the national laboratories.â€™

The US regularly conducts nuclear readiness exercises. One of the most recent significant drills was Global Thunder 25 (GT25), initiated by the US Strategic Command in October.

Last week, US President Donald Trump said he hoped to hold talks with Russia and China about reducing nuclear weapons stockpiles. According to Trump, the idea of denuclearization was previously backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump also argued that maintaining Americaâ€™s nuclear arsenal comes at a great expense and that â€˜tremendous amounts of money are being spent on nuclear, and the destructive capability is something that we donâ€™t even want to talk about.â€™

Russia and the US were previously committed to the New START arms control treaty, which required both nations to reduce their deployed strategic nuclear warheads. However, Moscow suspended its participation in 2023 in response to Washingtonâ€™s military support for Ukraine. Russia has nevertheless stated it will continue to adhere to the treatyâ€™s limits, with President Putin repeatedly emphasizing that nuclear weapons would only be used as a â€˜last resort.â€™",2025-01-27 16:15:09+00:00,en,Real

Russia Today

EU citizens should start stockpiling three daysâ€™ worth of goods in order to be ready for various potential disasters, including a nuclear conflict, a report has warned.

Published on Wednesday by former Finnish President Sauli Niinisto, the initiative is part of the EUâ€™s push to make the bloc more resilient in the face of supposedly mounting threats, ranging from natural disasters to a major military conflict.

The report encourages EU households to stockpile â€˜basic self-sufficiencyâ€™ goods that would last for at least 72 hours for fear of potential shortages in case of â€˜armed aggression through conventional meansâ€™ or other hostile activities such as â€˜cyberattacks or the use of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons.â€™

Brussels had tasked Finlandâ€™s former president earlier this year with assessing the EUâ€™s security needs following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict, â€˜responding in particular to Russiaâ€™s intensifying hybrid operations.â€™

â€˜One click can switch off power grids and plunge whole cities into the dark,â€™ European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the presentation of the report.

The document also calls on the EU to boost its defense and spend around 20% of its common budget, currently worth around â‚¬1 trillion ($1.08 trillion) over seven years, on security and crisis preparedness.

â€˜Member States should strengthen their cooperation on European defense, jointly investing more to close long-standing gaps in our military and defense industrial readiness,â€™ Niinisto said, reiterating the EUâ€™s commitment to provide aid for Ukraine in the long term.

The bloc also needs to establish an anti-sabotage network to fend off threats through greater information sharing, Finlandâ€™s former leader said, citing rising concerns over perceived threats from Russia.

â€˜Given the increasing use of sabotage by hostile third countries, notably Russia, it is an area where internal security and military security are very much interlinked,â€™ the report noted.

Niinisto also urged to â€˜strengthen EU intelligence structures step-by-step towards a fully-fledged EU service for intelligence cooperation.â€™

The report comes amid Western warnings regarding Russiaâ€™s alleged plans to attack Western Europe if it secures a victory over Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed the claims as â€˜nonsense.â€™ Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has similarly described the allegations as â€˜horror stories,â€™ and suggested they had been made up by Western leaders to distract peopleâ€™s attention from problems in their own countries.",2024-10-31 14:11:05+00:00,en,Real

NÃ¡vÅ¡tÄ›va ÄÃ­nskÃ©ho prezidenta Si Å¤in-pchinga v MoskvÄ› od 7. do 10. kvÄ›tna je oficiÃ¡lnÄ› zamÃ½Å¡lena jako pÅ™ipomÃ­nka 80. vÃ½roÄÃ­ konce druhÃ© svÄ›tovÃ© vÃ¡lky v EvropÄ›, pÅ™iÄemÅ¾ vrcholem bude jeho ÃºÄast na pÃ¡teÄnÃ­ pÅ™ehlÃ­dce na RudÃ©m nÃ¡mÄ›stÃ­.

Kontext, v nÄ›mÅ¾ se tato jednÃ¡nÃ­ konajÃ­, naznaÄuje, Å¾e budou vÃ½znamnÃ¡.

Zelenskyj pro zaÄÃ¡tek implicitnÄ› pohrozil, Å¾e Ukrajina by mohla zaÃºtoÄit na pÃ¡teÄnÃ­ pÅ™ehlÃ­dku, coÅ¾ nevyvolalo Å¾Ã¡dnou veÅ™ejnou reakci Trumpa, pÅ™estoÅ¾e se ke vÅ¡em ostatnÃ­m otÃ¡zkÃ¡m vyjÃ¡dÅ™il, takÅ¾e to lze interpretovat jako jeho tichÃ½ souhlas. Si Å¤in-pching tedy svou ÃºÄastÃ­ podstupuje skuteÄnÃ© osobnÃ­ riziko, ale zÃ¡roveÅˆ projevuje svou vÃ­ru v ruskÃ© ozbrojenÃ© sÃ­ly, kterÃ© majÃ­ za Ãºkol chrÃ¡nit jeho a ostatnÃ­ hosty. Tato propojenÃ¡ gesta Putin a vÅ¡ichni ruÅ¡tÃ­ politici jistÄ› ocenÃ­.

MÃ­rovÃ½ proces mezi Ruskem a Ukrajinou zprostÅ™edkovanÃ½ USA se dostal do slepÃ© uliÄky , kterou jeÅ¡tÄ› zhorÅ¡ujÃ­ Trumpovy spekulace, Å¾e ho Putin moÅ¾nÃ¡ jen â€žprovokujeâ€œ. ÄŒÃ­na realisticky nemÅ¯Å¾e nahradit USA, pokud se stÃ¡hnou, protoÅ¾e na Ukrajinu nemÃ¡ vliv, ale Si Å¤in-pching pravdÄ›podobnÄ› oÄekÃ¡vÃ¡ od Putina podrobnÃ½ popis toho, co se v poslednÃ­ dobÄ› pokazilo a proÄ. To by mohlo vÃ©st k dalÅ¡Ã­ ÄÃ¡sti jejich rozhovorÅ¯ o tom, co Rusko plÃ¡nuje udÄ›lat, pokud mÃ­rovÃ½ proces zkolabuje.

KromÄ› udrÅ¾enÃ­ vojenskÃ©ho tempa, jakÃ© tomu bylo po celou dobu, by Rusko mohlo rozÅ¡Ã­Å™it svou pozemnÃ­ kampaÅˆ do ukrajinskÃ½ch regionÅ¯, na kterÃ© si Moskva (zatÃ­m?) nenÃ¡rokuje. SoubÄ›Å¾nÄ› s tÃ­m by Trumpovo postupnÃ© vojenskÃ© zapojenÃ­ do konfliktu mohlo vÃ©st k jeho â€žeskalaci za ÃºÄelem deeskalaceâ€œ, aÅ¥ uÅ¾ ve vÃ½Å¡e uvedenÃ©m scÃ©nÃ¡Å™i, nebo jednoduÅ¡e jako trest za krach rozhovorÅ¯, pokud obvinÃ­ Putina. Putin by tak mohl od Si Å¤in-pchinga poÅ¾Ã¡dat o vojenskou pomoc nebo alespoÅˆ o zÃ¡vazek, Å¾e nebude dodrÅ¾ovat Å¾Ã¡dnÃ© dalÅ¡Ã­ sekundÃ¡rnÃ­ sankce .

ÄŒÃ­na dosud neposlala Rusku vojenskou pomoc a neformÃ¡lnÄ› jiÅ¾ dodrÅ¾uje nÄ›kterÃ© sankce, protoÅ¾e Si Å¤in-pching nechce USA provokovat. Jeho vÃ½poÄty se vÅ¡ak mohly zmÄ›nit od zaÄÃ¡tku Trumpovy globÃ¡lnÃ­ obchodnÃ­ vÃ¡lky , jejÃ­mÅ¾ cÃ­lem je kompenzovat trajektorii ÄŒÃ­ny jako supervelmoci . Pokud Si Å¤in-pching vÄ›Å™Ã­, Å¾e vÄ›tÅ¡Ã­ ekonomickÃ½ a/nebo vojenskÃ½ tlak ze strany USA je nevyhnutelnÃ½, pak by mohl PutinovÃ½m spekulativnÃ­m poÅ¾adavkÅ¯m vyhovÄ›t, ale pouze pokud vÃ½hody pÅ™evÃ¡Å¾Ã­ nÃ¡klady na urychlenÃ­ vÃ½Å¡e zmÃ­nÄ›nÃ© nÃ¡tlakovÃ© kampanÄ› USA.

VÃ½mÄ›nou za to, co poÅ¾adoval, by Putin mohl ustoupit Si Å¤in-pchingovu ÃºdajnÃ©mu poÅ¾adavku na sniÅ¾ovÃ¡nÃ­ cen plynu pro pozastavenÃ½ plynovod SÃ­la SibiÅ™e 2, nabÃ­dnout podobnÄ› preferenÄnÃ­ podmÃ­nky pro spoluprÃ¡ci na dalÅ¡Ã­ch projektech v oblasti zdrojÅ¯ (vÄetnÄ› vzÃ¡cnÃ½ch zemin) a posÃ­lit strategickou vojensko-technickou spoluprÃ¡ci . StruÄnÄ› Å™eÄeno, Putin by musel opustit rodÃ­cÃ­ se rusko â€“ americkÃ© â€ž novÃ© uvolnÄ›nÃ­ napÄ›tÃ­ â€œ, kterÃ© mÃ¡ posÃ­lit geostrategickÃ© vyvaÅ¾ovÃ¡nÃ­ jeho zemÄ›, coÅ¾ by z nÃ­ mohlo udÄ›lat â€žjuniornÃ­ho partneraâ€œ ÄŒÃ­ny.

JedinÃ½ scÃ©nÃ¡Å™, ve kterÃ©m by to vÃ¡Å¾nÄ› zvaÅ¾oval, by byl, kdyby mÃ­rovÃ¡ jednÃ¡nÃ­ propadla a USA â€žeskalovaly, aby deeskalovalyâ€œ, coÅ¾ jsou vzhledem k nedÃ¡vnÃ½m udÃ¡lostem vÄ›rohodnÃ© moÅ¾nosti, a proto by mohl bÄ›hem rozhovorÅ¯ tento tÃ½den s Si Å¤in-pchingem uzavÅ™Ã­t velkou dohodu, kterÃ¡ by vstoupila v platnost pouze v takovÃ©m pÅ™Ã­padÄ›. Pokud tedy chce Trump zabrÃ¡nit Rusku v nastartovÃ¡nÃ­ ÄÃ­nskÃ© supervelmoci, musÃ­ donutit Ukrajinu k dalÅ¡Ã­m ÃºstupkÅ¯m vÅ¯Äi Rusku za ukonÄenÃ­ konfliktu za lepÅ¡Ã­ch podmÃ­nek pro Putina.

This is a massive departure from the traditional process, which typically involves weeks of work from a team of analysts and lawyers.

Solomonâ€™s revelation has sparked considerable debate about the future of white-collar jobs, especially in finance. He shared these insights, noting how AI has revolutionized one of the most labor-intensive tasks in investment banking. Traditionally, a six-person team would spend two weeks preparing an IPO prospectus. Now, AI handles 95% of this work in mere minutes, leaving only 5% that still requires human expertise.

This development is both exciting and worrying. On the bright side, it promises to streamline the IPO process, making it faster and more cost-effective. However, it also raises serious concerns about job security. If AI can take over such a significant portion of this work, what does it mean for the analysts and lawyers who have traditionally performed these tasks?

Ukrainian elites have enriched themselves from embezzling US taxpayer money sent to fund the conflict with Russia, American journalist Tucker Carlson has claimed. He recounted his observations of affluent visitors at an elite ski resort, during an interview with retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis on Monday.

Carlson, a former Fox News host and a vocal opponent of US support for Ukraine, described his visit to a pricey resort in the Alps, where he discovered that â€œthe whole town is Ukrainian.â€

â€œAll the visitors are Ukrainian, and theyâ€™re rolling into Hermes, and dropping a million dollars in an afternoon. Itâ€™s all through Europe you see this. The richest people are the Ukrainians,â€ he said, adding that the money theyâ€™re throwing around â€œbelongs to me and you and every other American taxpayer.â€

Carlson went on to say that Ukrainian corruption not only squanders American resources but also endangers US citizens. He cited allegations of Ukrainian military personnel selling weapons on the black market, which have reportedly reached the Mexican drug cartels. He claimed to know this for a fact, but did not provide evidence.

Zelensky canâ€™t account for more than $100 billion in claimed US aid

â€Everyone who wants to know whatâ€™s going on knows,â€ Carlson said, accusing the media and officials from the administration of former President Joe Biden of covering up for Kiev.

The contrast between the amount of assistance for Ukraine and the affluence of some Ukrainians in the EU has fostered resentment in countries such as Poland, which has welcomed nearly a million Ukrainian refugees since the conflict escalated in 2022. In an interview last October, Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Poles are appalled by â€œthe sight of young men from Ukraine, driving the best cars, spending weekends in five-star hotels.â€ Opinion polls suggest a shift in public sentiment against Ukrainians.

In recent remarks, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky claimed that his country has received substantially less US aid than reported, saying the total is $76 billion, rather than $200 billion, which is often cited. He added that around 70,000 Ukrainian soldiers have died in the conflict so far.

Carlson highlighted both of these claims, calling them examples of blatant lies that the Western media reports uncritically.

66,A Review Of The Most Common Roles In The Alt-Media Community - TheAltWorld,https://thealtworld.com/andrew_korybko/a-review-of-the-most-common-roles-in-the-alt-media-community,https://de.rt.com/afrika/181108-neu-gegruendete-sahel-allianz-wird/,Die neu gegrÃ¼ndete Sahel-Allianz wird die regionale militÃ¤risch-strategische Dynamik neu gestalten â€” RT DE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1/23/2025,thealtworld.com,A Review Of The Most Common Roles In The Alt-Media Community,"The Alt-Media Community has many ways in which its members express support for various causes and countries, but the intentions behind some of their information products are sometimes regrettably misinterpreted by their fellows, hence the need to elaborate on the most common roles that folks play.

Whatâ€™s The Alt-Media Community?

The Alt-Media Community (AMC) is a general term that refers to those individuals and outlets that arenâ€™t part of the Mainstream Media (MSM). It includes casual commentators such as the majority of its membership, independent platforms like the Centre for Research on Globalization, key influencers like some of the folks who might come to the readerâ€™s mind when thinking about the AMC, and publicly financed platforms such as RT. Itâ€™s a cosmopolitan community thatâ€™s united around their common interest in multipolarity, which can be described as the international system thatâ€™s emerging in the wake of unipolarityâ€™s comparative decline from the days when the US was the worldâ€™s sole superpower. As such, itâ€™s ultra-diverse and its members donâ€™t always share the same assessments of every cause, country, and event, but this is natural and to be encouraged.

Principles & Shortcomings

The AMC is supposed to at least in theory treasure a diversity of well-intended and respectful discourse about sensitive topics aimed at better understanding complex processes. It was never intended to function as a knockoff of the MSM in the sense of gatekeepers aggressively imposing their interpretations onto others under the pane of â€œexileâ€ from the community for daring to responsibly express different views about any given issue. Regrettably, some of the most impassioned members of the AMC at times misinterpret their peersâ€™ opinions, especially whenever these manifest themselves as information products such as analyses, interviews, journalism, published commentary, and videos. Unfortunately, they occasionally accuse those who think differently of being so-called â€œhatersâ€ of a certain cause or country, and in rare cases, even worse.

Disclaimer

Itâ€™s for this reason why itâ€™s necessary to talk about the most common types of members in the AMC. The purpose in doing so is to dispel any misperceptions about their intentions in order to hopefully prevent the unnecessary discord which threatens to divide this already loosely connected community even more. Of course, those with ulterior motives (perhaps pertaining either to ego, ideology, and/or profit with respect to soliciting more donations from wishful thinking, naive, but well-intended members of their audience) will likely still smear those who disagree with them, but the sincere members of the AMC might think twice about doing so once if theyâ€™ve come to appreciate how those who disagree with them still in spirit support the same cause and/or country as they do, albeit from a different angle.

The Importance Of Media Literacy

What follows is a concise list of the roles that each of the AMCâ€™s many members most commonly play. Itâ€™s entirely possible for someone to play different roles at the same time, or to even switch between them. After all, thatâ€™s only natural since its members are human beings and not robots. Everyoneâ€™s entitled to their own views. All that matters is that they have positive intentions to promote multipolarity as they sincerely understand it, which can sometimes even change with time. So long as one has the proper media literacy, they should be able to easily discern the following roles. Whatâ€™s most important is that folks appreciate all of the information products that their fellows produce apart from whenever this manifests itself as fake news of course, be it the creation or sharing thereof (especially whenever the latter is intentional).

AMC Roles

* The Activist:

Activists passionately promote the causes and/or countries that they sincerely believe to be forces of good in the world. Theyâ€™re the most opinionated members of the AMC and arenâ€™t afraid to hide it. They sometimes omit certain facts in order to advance their narrative, but they presumably do this with good intentions despite it being of questionable ethics. They aim to convince others to support the same things that they do, believing that the cumulative effect of their efforts can make a noticeable difference with time. Activists tend to be very creative with their approaches and also pretty persuasive too, if at times a bit edgy, even uncomfortably so.

* The Amplifier:

Similar in essence to activists, amplifiers also feel very passionately about certain causes and/or countries, but they generally express this by mostly only amplifying the primary talking points of the latter. Theyâ€™re less creative than activists but no less zealous. Itâ€™s just that they believe that their skills and time are best invested in sharing simple points â€“ usually from official sources like publicly financed media or representatives of a particular cause and/or country â€“ that might usually be ignored or misportrayed by the MSM. In their own humble way, theyâ€™re providing valuable information support to something that they sincerely care about.

* The Analyst:

Analysts are a bit different from activists and amplifiers. They at times partially fulfill both functions, but their information products are intended to interpret events comparatively more objectively. This sometimes results in them making constructive critiques of the causes and/or countries that they support. Nevertheless, their intentions are to responsibly raise awareness of what might be regarded by most of the AMC as so-called â€œpolitically incorrectâ€ points that challenge narrative dogma, highlight perceived policy shortcomings, and thus ultimately improve the effectiveness of certain causes and/or countries as a result.

* The Casual Commentator:

The vast majority of the AMC is comprised of casual commentators. Theyâ€™re interested in multipolarity, whether in general or only with respect to a particular topic, but arenâ€™t passionate enough to devote their time to playing any of the communityâ€™s other roles. Still, casual commentators will sometimes donate to independent Alt-Media individuals and/or outlets as a sign of solidarity if they can afford to do so. Every other role is inspired to produce their respective work for the benefit of the casual commentator, whether to convince them to take a certain position or simply as a courtesy to inform them of an interesting interpretation.

* The Journalist:

This role is often misattributed by casual commentators to those who play other roles and even at times wrongly self-proclaimed by the latter as well. Journalists are in principle the paragon of objectivity, or at least thatâ€™s what they aspire to be. Theyâ€™ll share both sides of the story, though naturally sometimes subtly expressing support for one over the other. Nevertheless, their work isnâ€™t noticeably opinionated because such manifestations are actually activism or amplification even though those two roles sometimes describe their information products as journalism in order to make them more convincing to casual commentators.

* The Questioner:

Questioners are perhaps the most controversial members of the AMC. Theyâ€™re so intrepid that they wonâ€™t shy away from asking hard questions that the casual commentator either wouldnâ€™t ever think of or dare to say (the latter perhaps due to fear of being â€œexiledâ€ by the communityâ€™s gatekeepers for defying narrative dogma). Some folks might question their motives, but no suspicion should be automatically cast on these well-intended individuals who simply seek to challenge others to better articulate their positions on certain causes and/or countries. Trolls sometimes masquerade as questioners, but the vast majority of questioners arenâ€™t trolls.

Syrian Examples

Syria and its anti-terrorism struggle are among the top countries and causes supported by the AMC, while â€œIsraeliâ€ strikes against the IRGC and Hezbollah there serve as perhaps their most controversial aspect of this subject since many in the community mistakenly expected Russia to directly intervene to stop them by now. I explained why Russia wonâ€™t do this in an earlier analysis that cites 15 relevant prior pieces on the topic, as well as a follow-up one that debunked some viral fake news back in February that revived that false narrative. Both hyperlinked analyses as well as this one about the impact of those strikes on Iranâ€™s strategic position in Syria should be reviewed by readers who arenâ€™t already familiar with them before proceeding:

* The Activist:

The tell-tale sign of someone playing the role of an activist in this context is if they simply distract from the â€œtabooâ€ subject of Russian-â€Israeliâ€ relations whenever these strikes occur. They seem to fear the effect that wider awareness of those twoâ€™s close ties in that country might have on influencing the position of casual commentators towards Russia and/or Syria, hence why itâ€™s â€œverbotenâ€. Instead, they usually seek to rally the community by repeating anti-Zionist slogans, condemning â€œIsraelâ€, and praising Syria/Iran/Hezbollah. Regrettably, a few sometimes go too far and smear analysts and questioners who discuss the â€œforbiddenâ€ topic.

* The Amplifier:

Unlike the activist, the amplifier mostly restricts themselves to sharing official statements about the matter, especially whenever Russia occasionally condemns these strikes for violating international law. They also uncritically share reports from publicly financed Syrian media and supportive members of the AMC which usually claim that those strikes barely caused any damage, let alone casualties. Sometimes, however, subsequent facts as reported by those same sources will prove that those reports were premature. The amplifier doesnâ€™t always update their audience, though, since they mostly only care about the first impression.

* The Analyst:

Sincere analysts, and not activists masquerading as them, confidently tackle the â€œtabooâ€ by sharing â€œpolitically inconvenientâ€ facts (including those from the official Kremlin website) confirming the closeness of Russian-â€Israeliâ€ ties. Their intention isnâ€™t to â€œdiscreditâ€ Russia, but to dispel the false expectations that many casual commentators have of it as a result of yearsâ€™ worth of inaccurate wishful thinking reports (if not outright deliberate disinformation in some cases) from the AMC. They believe that everyone deserves to know the facts as they objectively exist, after which theyâ€™re interpreted to articulate (not necessarily endorse) Russian policy.

* The Casual Commentator:

The AMC masses nowadays seem to be divided over the manufactured controversy of whether or not Russia is secretly against â€œIsraelâ€. The only reason for such confusion is because they were indoctrinated for years by false information as mentioned above and it was only recently that some of them finally became aware of the facts. Because of the sensitivity surrounding this subject, many casual commentators have a tendency to turn into activists or questioners, the first of which almost always regrettably reinforce the false narrative that Russia is secretly against â€œIsraelâ€ while the latter challenge others to accept the truth of Russian-â€Israeliâ€ relations.

* The Journalist:

Genuine journalism on this subject doesnâ€™t really exist in the AMC and is either activism or analysis. Thatâ€™s because the issue is so polarizing since many casual commentators were already indoctrinated into believing a false interpretation of events. As such, information products can only by default either reinforce or contradict their audienceâ€™s manufactured expectations, which respectively makes them activism or analysis. In the future, it might be possible to produce journalistic reports about the issue, but itâ€™s much too premature to talk about that right now.

* The Questioner:

These folks are the most misunderstood and consequently reviled members of the AMC in this context. Questioners criticize the AMCâ€™s gatekeepers for manipulating the minds of casual commentators. Their well-intended questions are oftentimes maliciously misportrayed by the most radical activists as being â€œevidence of Zionismâ€ or even of one allegedly being a so-called â€œdisinformation agentâ€. In reality, the only disinformation is the unprovoked and almost always unsubstantiated ad hominem attacks made against those who dare to challenge the AMCâ€™s prevailing but nevertheless objectively false dogma that Russia is against â€œIsraelâ€.

Concluding Thoughts

Every role played by the AMCâ€™s many members, especially with respect to the sensitive subject of â€œIsraeliâ€ strikes against the IRGC and Hezbollah in Syria, is important and should be appreciated by all. Only those activists who cross the line by attacking well-intended members of the community, particularly analysts and questioners, are doing something wrong. Instead of shunning them, however, the responsible members of the community should politely make them aware of why their aggressive behavior is so unacceptable and counterproductive to the same cause and country (in this case Syria) that everyone supports in their own way. Itâ€™s one thing to constructively critique the impact (whether unintended or not) of a fellow memberâ€™s work, and another entirely to maliciously defame them. For the AMC to survive, it must learn to respect different views.

ðŸ”´ Trump disapproval: 43% 58% say he is doing better than Biden

81% support deporting criminal aliens

76% support eliminating fraud, waste

76% support closing the U.S. border

70% support merit-based hiring

61% supportâ€¦ â€” End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) February 24, 2025

A new Harvard Harris poll is sending shockwaves through the political landscape. Former President Trumpâ€™s approval stands at a solid 52%, up a surprising 9 points. Meanwhile, his disapproval is at 43%, putting him in a commanding position. This isnâ€™t just a bumpâ€”itâ€™s a trend that seems to be accelerating.

The numbers are even more telling when it comes to the national mood. 58% of voters believe Trump is outperforming Biden, and the sentiment isnâ€™t just based on his wordsâ€”itâ€™s rooted in action.

Voters are beginning to realize that, at the end of the day, itâ€™s policies that matter, not partisan squabbling. Trumpâ€™s track record on issues like crime, waste, and border security is starting to resonate more deeply. A whopping 81% want criminal aliens deported, 76% demand action on eliminating government waste, and 76% also want the U.S. border shut down. This isnâ€™t a fringe minorityâ€”itâ€™s the majority speaking up, loud and clear.

Democrats are losing their grip on the conversation. The Harvard poll shows approval for the Democratic Party is at an all-time low, with voters becoming increasingly disillusioned by their performance. As Mark Penn, Co-Director of the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, noted, â€œPeople are reassessing their attitudes toward Biden, Harris, and the Democrats, taking a much harsher, more negative attitude.â€

With a growing number of voters turning against the current administration, Trump is positioned to capitalize on the shifting tides. A â€œwait-and-seeâ€ attitude is prevailing, and if he can keep the momentum, it could shift into a decisive wave of support.

The state of the country, according to voters, is starting to look a little brighter. 42% say the country is on the right track, a 14-point surge from January 2025. This isnâ€™t just a shift in party linesâ€”Democrats have seen a 9-point drop in optimism, while Republicans are seeing a 37-point surge. Independents are coming around too, with a 12-point improvement, showing that dissatisfaction with the status quo is driving many to reconsider their options.

As for the economy, voters are showing increasing confidence. 31% report their personal financial situation is improving, especially among Republicans, men, Black voters, and urban populations. This isnâ€™t just some hopeful rhetoricâ€”itâ€™s a reflection of real economic improvements, with people feeling the impact of positive changes on the ground.

But the big-ticket items on the table remain inflation and immigration. Voters are growing more concerned about government corruption, as well. And theyâ€™re not waiting for a hero to save themâ€”they want the government to get its act together. 72% of voters think Dogecoin is helping make major cuts in government expenditures, reflecting a deep desire for accountability in government spending. A shocking 67% of voters believe the current U.S. federal government debt is unsustainable.

In a stunning turn of events, 83% of voters want government expenditures slashed rather than seeing tax hikes. A solid 77% agree on the necessity of a comprehensive examination of all government expenditures. No longer content with the status quo, theyâ€™re demanding cuts, and theyâ€™re pushing for a thorough overhaul of bloated programs.

The pressure is building, and itâ€™s clear that the American people are done with inefficiency, waste, and corruption in Washington. 70% of voters agree that government spending is filled with fraud and inefficiency. While party lines matter, itâ€™s clear that when it comes to eliminating waste, people are more aligned than they realize.

The polling data reveals something even more important: voters are awake. Theyâ€™re not buying into the usual rhetoric, and theyâ€™re seeing through the smoke and mirrors of the political elite. This could be a turning point, as Americans push for the changes they need to fix the system. And with an approval rate this strong, itâ€™s clear that Trump is positioning himself as the voice of that change.

66,Are Chinese Soldiers Fighting in Ukraine? | The Libertarian Institute,https://libertarianinstitute.org/articles/are-chinese-soldiers-fighting-in-ukraine/,https://www.rt.com/russia/594276-ukraine-foreign-mercenaries-killed/,claimed,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,4/14/2025,libertarianinstitute.org,Are Chinese Soldiers Fighting in Ukraine?,"If Chinese soldiers are fighting in the Russian armed forces in Ukraine, that is not the big story. The big story is the effect the claim could have on the possibility of peace.

Ukraine has not yet even proven the months old claim of the presence of North Korean soldiers fighting for Russia on Russian soil. Now they are making the much more provocative claim that Chinese soldiers are fighting for Russia on Ukrainian soil.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on April 9 that the Ukrainian armed forces had captured two Chinese soldiers fighting in the Donetsk region of Ukraine. He then said that Ukrainian intelligence has uncovered 155 Chinese citizens who are â€œfighting against Ukrainians on the territory of Ukraineâ€ and that they â€œbelieve that there are many more of them.â€

Independent journalists and organizations have not had access to the two prisoners in order to verify the truth of the claim. Ukraine has provided a video and documents listing names and passport documents. Media outlets have seen them, but CNN and The Independent both say that they have not been independently verified.

There are tens and perhaps even hundreds of thousands of ethnic Chinese living in Russia. And even if the captured soldiers are from China, that does not mean they were sent by China. They could have enlisted on their own as mercenaries, a possibility that two former U.S. intelligence officers â€œwith knowledge of the issueâ€ now say U.S. intelligence believes to be the case. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the claim that many Chinese citizens are fighting in the Russian army â€œtotally unfounded,â€ and said that â€œthe Chinese government always asks Chinese citizens to stay away from conflict zones, avoid getting involved in any form of armed conflict, and especially refrain from participating in any partyâ€™s military operations.â€

Zelensky, though, has made the provocative claim that the Chinese government is allowing its citizens to fight in Ukraine. Asked whether China had a policy of sending soldiers to Ukraine, Zelensky answered, â€œI donâ€™t have an answer to this question yet. The Security Service of Ukraine will work on itâ€¦We are not saying that someone gave any command, we do not have such information.â€ However, he added that â€œ[o]fficial Beijing knows about thisâ€ and did not prevent it.

Zelensky then escalated the claim, saying, â€œThe Chinese issue is seriousâ€ and calling on â€œthe U.S. and the rest of the world for a response.â€

It is that threat to the peace process and not the possible presence of Chinese soldiers that is serious and significant. Mercenaries from many countries have been welcomed by both Ukraine and Russia since the beginning of the war. Al Jazeera reports that, not only Chinese, but Nepalese and Indians have fought for Russia. They also report that Colombians, Sri Lankans, Indians and Americans have fought for Ukraine. At least nine Canadians have been killed in Ukraine, and more are known to have fought there. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed in March 2024 that 1,005 Canadian mercenaries have fought in Ukraine. They also claim that 2,960 have come from Poland, 1,113 from the United States, 356 from France and others from the United Kingdom and Romania. Ukraine says their international legion comprises around 20,000 fighters from fifty countries.

More seriously, it is not just mercenaries who have arrived in Ukraine. A leaked March 2023 Defense Department document reveals the presence of 97 NATO special forces in Ukraine. A recent New York Times article reports that more than three dozen military advisers were sent to Kiev and that CIA officers were in Kharkiv and â€œcommand posts closer to the fighting.â€ The British prime ministerâ€™s office has confirmed that the United Kingdom has boots on the ground in Ukraine. The presence of French forces has also been revealed, and Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski confirmed that â€œNATO soldiers are already present in Ukraine.â€

Unless the Chinese government has a policy of sending troops to fight alongside Russia in Ukraine, which would be serious, since it could draw China into the war, it is not the alleged presence of Chinese soldiers that is dangerous. At a time when peace talks are at a fragile beginning, and U.S. President Donald Trump is insisting on both sides showing they are serious about peace, it is the provocative statements coming out of Kiev that are potentially serious.

â€œRussiaâ€™s involvement of China, along with other countries, whether directly or indirectly, in this war in Europe is a clear signal that Putin intends to do anything but end the war,â€ Zelensky said. â€œThis definitely requires a response. A response from the United States, Europe, and all those around the world who want peace.â€ The suggestion that Putin is not serious about negotiating undermines U.S. led negotiations.

The statements are also ill timed and hazardous. The United States and China are engaged in a trade war. It is a volatile time to provide Washington with a cause for turning up its anger against China. Zelensky intends the presence of Chinese soldiers to evoke an American response. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the U.S. is â€œaware of those reportsâ€ and that â€œItâ€™s disturbing with the Chinese soldiers having been captured,â€ though the White House has not confirmed the claim. National Security Spokesman Brian Hughes said that â€œif the Chinese government is allowing their citizens to fight on behalf of the Russia government, this would be a concerning escalation and the U.S. will consider options moving forward.â€

Beyond challenging the peace process, the comments coming out of Kiev are provocative to China, questioning its credibility and its lack of involvement in the war. Equally importantly, it challenges any potential role of China both in the negotiations before the end of the war and in security arrangements after the end of the war: both potentially important roles for China.

Ukraineâ€™s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Andrii Sybiha, said that â€œChinese citizens fighting as part of Russiaâ€™s invasion army in Ukraine puts into questionâ€ not only â€œChinaâ€™s declared stance for peaceâ€ but even that it â€œundermines Beijingâ€™s credibility as a responsible permanent member of the UN Security Council.â€

If the two captured soldiers turn out to be from China, and if they turn out to be mercenaries fighting without the approval of China, then their presence in Ukraine is not the big story. If the claims being made about them and about China resonate in the White House, then the effect of the claims could make difficult peace talks even more difficult. And that is what the potential big story would turn out to be.",2025-04-14 06:00:34-05:00,en,Fake

President Donald Trump announced that a 25% tariff will be imposed on goods from Canada and Mexico, while an additional 10% tariff will be applied to goods from China. These measures are part of the administrationâ€™s efforts to address issues such as drug trafficking and trade imbalances.

The tariffs on Canada and Mexico were initially delayed last month following last-minute concessions from both countries. However, President Trump stated that there is â€œno room leftâ€ for further negotiations, and the tariffs will go into effect as planned. The White House has justified these tariffs by pointing to the ongoing issues of fentanyl and other drug trafficking across the northern and southern borders.

Key Points:

Tariffs on Canada and Mexico : 25% tariff on imports.

: 25% tariff on imports. Tariffs on China : Additional 10% tariff on imports.

: Additional 10% tariff on imports. Effective Date: The tariffs will go into effect tonight.

According to the latest data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, rejection rates for loans, including credit cards, mortgages, and auto loans, have spiked to 23%. This figure marks the highest recorded since the depths of the financial crisis, signaling a significant contraction in credit availability.

Moreover, the rejection rate for credit card limit increases has reached nearly 50%, indicating that even those with existing credit lines are facing unprecedented hurdles in expanding their credit. This surge in rejection rates is not merely a statistical anomaly but reflects a systemic shift in how financial institutions are managing risk in an increasingly uncertain economic environment.

A detailed analysis by the New York Fedâ€™s Credit Access Survey shows that this trend has been particularly harsh on younger borrowers and those with lower credit scores. For instance, individuals under 40 have seen application rejection rates exceed those of their older counterparts, highlighting a generational gap in credit access. Additionally, those with credit scores below 680 are facing rejection rates well above pre-pandemic levels, with auto loan rejections hitting an all-time high since the surveyâ€™s inception in 2013.

The ramifications of this credit crunch are far-reaching. For many Americans, the ability to finance significant life events or manage daily expenses through credit has become more challenging. A Bankrate survey reveals that 50% of loan applicants have been denied since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, impacting their financial stability and major life decisions like buying a home or a car.

Economic analysts attribute this tightening to a combination of factors: rising interest rates have made borrowing more costly, inflation has squeezed household budgets, and banks, still cautious from previous economic shocks, are more selective in their lending. This environment has led to a situation where, as noted by Forbes, even small businesses are increasingly relying on high-cost financing options like credit cards, with many unable to pay off these balances monthly.

Furthermore, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has noted an increase in consumer complaints regarding credit denials, suggesting not just a quantitative but also a qualitative shift in how credit is being accessed and managed. This was echoed in social media and financial forums where users report longer waits for approval decisions and more stringent credit checks.

As credit becomes scarcer, consumers are forced into more conservative financial behaviors, potentially slowing economic activity. This scenario might require a recalibration of personal financial strategies, with an emphasis on saving rather than borrowing. For financial institutions, the challenge lies in maintaining a balance between risk management and supporting economic growth.

Israel has launched what is being dubbed â€œone of the largestâ€ attacks on Syria in history. The large-scale attack on targets in Syria using warplanes pounded at least three airports and other infrastructure.

This attack followed the demise of former President Bashar Assadâ€™s government, according to several media reports. Assad fled to Russia as the current ruling class fell to rebel forces.

Syrian Ruler Steps Down, Flees To Russia

Israeli tanks have reportedly broken out of the buffer zone adjacent to the illegally occupied Golan Heights, on the Syrian border, and moved towards Damascus, although West Jerusalem has denied the claim. An unnamed Israeli security source told Israeli Army Radio that â€œmore than 250 military targets were attacked in Syria,â€ describing the assault as â€œone of the largest attack operations in the history ofâ€¦ [the] air force.â€

The targets included â€œbases of Assad army, dozens of fighter jets, dozens of surface-to-air missile systems, production sites, and warehousesâ€¦ and surface-to-surface missiles.â€

According to several local media outlets, Israeli tanks had been approaching the Syrian capital. However, the Israeli military has denied that claim. A defense official told RT that â€œthe reports circulating in the media about the alleged advancement of Israeli tanks towards Damascus are false,â€ adding that â€œIDF troops are stationed within the buffer zone, as stated in the past.â€

The Jewish stateâ€™s military moved to capture the buffer zone established as part of the 1974 disengagement agreement not far from Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar insisted that the incursion is a â€œtemporary stepâ€ aimed solely at ensuring security. However, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel intends to retain total control over the Golan Heights, which it has illegally occupied since the 1967 Six-Day War, â€œforever,â€ calling the area â€œan inseparable partâ€ of his country. â€“RT

It is possible that this escalation will cause a wider war, but so far, the attacks have been contained in the Middle East.

Germany, China, Vietnam face mounting economic challenges.","As 2025 unfolds, economies worldwide are experiencing a resurgence in inflation. This trend, following a period of perceived stability, has significant implications for global markets.

Germany has reported a year-on-year increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of 2.6% for December, higher than the estimated 2.2% and matching Novemberâ€™s rate. This rise marks the highest inflation since January 2024. Meanwhile, Chinaâ€™s M1 money supply growth is anticipated to turn positive, signaling potential economic recovery. Vietnam is also making headlines as its Treasury plans to auction off 7.50 trillion Dong, influenced by concerns over inflation, tariffs, debt, and growth revisions.

The rising inflation in Germany points to persistent economic challenges. Chinaâ€™s shift towards positive M1 growth suggests a potential economic rebound, with possible global market impacts. Vietnamâ€™s substantial auction underscores the efforts to manage financial stability amidst various economic pressures.

These developments highlight the delicate balance modern economies must maintain to achieve sustainable growth while managing inflation. As we navigate through 2025, monitoring these trends will be crucial for understanding their broader economic impacts.

One of the Executive Orders that Trump just signed suspends some foreign aid for 90 days, specifically â€œdevelopment assistance funds to foreign countries and implementing non-governmental organizations, international organizations, and contractorsâ€, in order to assess their â€œefficiencies and consistency with US foreign policyâ€. It remains unclear at the time of writing whether the State Departmentâ€™s subsequent â€œstop-work ordersâ€ will affect military aid to Ukraine so that possibility wonâ€™t be covered in this analysis.

Most foreign aid programs have been exploited to meddle in other countriesâ€™ affairs by funding anti-government and even in some cases anti-state movements that later orchestrate Color Revolutions. Even if theyâ€™re not taken to that extreme, they at the very least create problems for the implementation of those countriesâ€™ domestic and foreign policies by artificially manufacturing grassroots opposition to them, which manipulates perceptions of their popularity and can thus influence national elections.

Such was recently the case in Georgia, which fended off a nearly-two-year-long Western-backed but superficially â€œNGOâ€-driven campaign against the ruling party. This was officially waged in response to their FARA-inspired foreign agents law but was really punishment for them pragmatically refusing to sanction Russia and open up a â€œsecond frontâ€ against it in the South Caucasus during Ukraineâ€™s failed summer 2023 counteroffensive. Georgia can now rest a bit easier for the time being.

The same goes for the many African countries like new BRICS partner Uganda whoâ€™ve been aggressively pressured by American-backed â€œNGOsâ€ into accepting the normalization of LGBT+ in contravention of their traditional values. As put forth in Trumpâ€™s Executive Order, â€œThe United States foreign aid industry and bureaucracyâ€¦serve to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries that are directly inverse to harmonious and stable relations internal to and among countries.â€

Observers also shouldnâ€™t forget about India after the US meddled in last yearâ€™s elections despite their strategic partnership. Russia gave voice to Indiaâ€™s concerns at the time due to the sensitivity of India calling the US out while the political process was ongoing, after which the ruling BJP accused the State Department and the â€œdeep stateâ€ of meddling in other matters last month. While independently financed Soros still remains a problem, the US government shouldnâ€™t be one for now, to Indiaâ€™s relief.

Less political meddling and socio-cultural engineering, at least for the next three months, will be much appreciated by all those countries that have been targeted by â€œNGOâ€-driven Hybrid War. The emphasis is on less of these efforts as opposed to their complete freeze since some programs might have enough funds left to partially operate during the interim while the Secretary of State can issue waivers for specific ones at his discretion. Some might therefore continue in full but most will be adversely affected.

The end effect is that American influence might rebound in the Global South since a large part of why many of these countries started turning away from the US since the start of the century was due to it violating their sovereignty by funding â€œNGOsâ€ that meddle in their affairs. If Trump reforms the USâ€™ international lending strategy to remove political strings on aid programs, including from those institutions that it controls like the IMF and World Bank, then this process would further accelerate.

His promised imposition of more tariffs might trouble some of these same countries, but itâ€™s not the same as coercing them into making political and socio-cultural changes against their will in exchange for emergency financial aid, which ultimately risks destabilizing them and later advancing regime change. This potentially new approach could restore some of the attractiveness in partnering with the US by partially evening the odds vis-Ã -vis its competitions with China and Russia in the Global South.

In the event that this comes to pass, then those two would be compelled to offer better deals to their partners in order to prevent them from being enticed by the US into accepting whatever it proposes, thus possibly catalyzing a cycle of competition that works to those other countriesâ€™ benefit. For that to happen, the US would have to treat its partners more as equals and less as vassals, but old habits die hard so this canâ€™t be taken for granted even if Trump appears somewhat (key qualifier) interested in it.

NBC claims that Israel has identified targets to hit in its retaliation against Iran, which would focus on military and energy infrastructure [3]. It is unclear whether this includes oil and gas facilities, which would hurt Kamala Harris, a fan of the 20-year-delayed green agenda, and benefit oilman Trump.

Beyond the remarkable analysis of Thierry Meyssan, who knows like few others the hierarchy of the Persian theocracy - he claims that the assassination of the Lebanese Shiite leader Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah was perpetrated by elements of the Mossad operating within the Iranian regime [4] - the famous American nuclear inspector Scott Ritter (SR), who had not managed to find the hilarious weapons of mass destruction of Saddam Hussein, the very ones that served as a pretext for the American war against Iraq, addresses in a poignant video [5] the strong probability that Israel will drop its clandestine atomic bombs on one of the main sites of Iranâ€™s peaceful nuclear projects, at Fordow [6], in the mountainous bowels of Iran.

Historian Eric Zuesse recommends watching the video above by Scott Ritter, who describes the baseness of Israel and the United States [7]. From minute 12 to minute 20, in 8 minutes, SR explains that â€œIsrael will use its nuclear weapons (sic!) to strike Fordowâ€. SR takes for granted Israelâ€™s clandestine nuclear endowment (served by atomic scientists with whom he collaborated), without specifying its quantity or quality.

According to him, a launch of conventional weapons would not disturb Iran too much, as would be the case with the B-61 tactical thermonuclear gravity bombs - dropped by B-2 bombers - or the W72/D2 tactical nuclear warheads with low atomic content dropped by Trident submarines.

Based on his nuclear expertise, SR considers that Iran is already a nuclear power, and it has little time left to manufacture its own bombs, without the help of Russia, since it has the know-how to do so.

Beyond the astonishing precision capability of hypersonic missiles, which struck the Nevatim military base - where Israel concentrates its best F-35 aircraft, 20 of which were reportedly destroyed by Iranâ€™s unstoppable hypersonic missiles, which is severely criticized by the Netanyahu government - 16 kilometers from the clandestine Dimona nuclear power plant [8], Iranâ€™s nuclear technological capacity, still peaceful today, constitutes a ""game changer"".

According to SR, it would be suicidal for the genocidal Netanyahu to launch his nuclear bombs against Iran, which would retaliate as it should, leading to the destruction of Israel [9]. SR claims that Iranian retaliation would cost the lives of 12 (sic) million people in Israel - he surely added the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank - and that in total, it would wipe out 100 (sic) million human beings throughout the Middle East: if Iran is bombed, it will be the end of Israel (minute 18).

Unless we are witnessing a new choreography of give and take between Israel and Iranâ€”one that will leave Iranâ€™s nuclear facilities and hydrocarbon infrastructure untouchedâ€”it seems very strange that, in this sequence of retaliation, it has occurred to the United States to immediately place a Thaad anti-missile system in Israel to repel Iranian retaliation ( [10].

If this is not a scene from Bidenâ€™s Kabuki theater, it seems implausible that U.S. military strategists are unaware that the Thaad anti-missile system stationed in Israel cannot stop Iranâ€™s unstoppable hypersonic missiles, whose primary target would be the clandestine nuclear reactor at Dimona, without the need to drop nuclear bombs that Iran does not yet possess.",2024-10-15 05:56:09+00:00,en,Fake
63,Third World War Has Never Been Closer - THE GOVERNMENT RAG INTELLIGENCE REPORT,https://thegovernmentrag.com/articles/third-world-war-has-never-been-closer/,https://www.rt.com/podcast/602027-netanyahu-trying-create-greater-israel/,last August,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,4/3/2025,thegovernmentrag.com,Third World War Has Never Been Closer,"Since March 15th, President Donald Trump has engaged in day and night bombing raids over the Houthi strongholds both in the Yemen capital of Sanaa as well as other Houthi military resistance sites. Over this last weekend Trump intensified US airstrikes after the so-called punisher last Wednesday March 26th touted:

The Houthis are dying for peace. They donâ€™t want thisâ€¦ But the Houthis have been hit hard, and they want to negotiate peace. The Houthis have been horrible to the world. Theyâ€™ve killed a lot of people and knocked out a lot of ships and planes and anything elseâ€¦ They have been hit harder than they have ever been.

Trump fails to mention how the Houthis as Middle East resistance fighters are among the only Muslims willing to put their lives on the line with the moral conviction to support their fellow Arab brethren suffering in Gaza, in stiff opposition to this egregious US-Israel genocide crime against Palestinians. Standing up for this righteous cause, Ansar Allah warriors have effectively neutralized 80% of the Red Sea shipping lane traffic that serves as a key Israeli supply-line in a modern David vs. Goliath scenario. Other than Lebanonâ€™s Hezbollah along Israelâ€™s northern border, no other Muslim group or nation has dared to fight or intervene against Israel delivered US bombs. Outside of empty rhetoric, the Islamic community remains passive and impotent to stop Israel. Thus, much of the world sees the Houthis of Yemen lined up on the right side of history, taking a courageous stand to resist and actually try and stop the bloody carnage in Gaza and now West Bank while the rest of the world passively looks on.

Moreover, during the last decade, Yemen faced an existential war that brought the US-Israel embargo, famine, hundreds of Saudi-US airstrikes, and against all odds, the persevering Houthis were victorious, outlasting the genocidal US bombs during the Houthisâ€™ decade of resistance opposing and toppling their the US-Saudi imperialist backed proxy government. Yemenis are a tenacious people who have overcome horrendous adversity and odds, now continuing to step up in defiant defense of their fellow Muslims.

While Trump hurls false, baseless insults at Yemen, he fails to mention how much human suffering on this planet his own Empire of Chaos & Destruction has historically, routinely caused. As a for instance, from 2001 to 2021 the US has killed over 30 million Muslims, the vast majority noncombatant civilians, during Americaâ€™s so-called â€œWar on Terror,â€ waging nonstop wars for the Greater Israel Project. Throughout Middle East wars and beyond, the US, Israel and oil-rich Gulf States consistently create, finance, arm and covertly train proxy war terrorists who as hired mercenaries do not practice Islam, created solely to destabilize and terrorize this embattled Israel-US targeted region, all the while US-Israel regularly defy all international law to engage in nonstop regime change operations, stealing Arab oil while targeting and crushing multiple nations brutalized by unchecked Israeli-US aggression, deliberately, systematically turning nation after nation into failed state wastelands â€“ Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan readily come to mind as Greater Israel war fatalities. By the way, all these nations before 9/11 resisted Rothschild installed central banks in their country.

Starting with the still unprosecuted 9/11 Israeli-US â€œinside job,â€ the dual citizen joint terrorist false flag operation committed on US soil murdering 3,000 Americans, served as their plotted â€œnew Pearl Harborâ€ excuse to then launch their infamously disastrous â€œWar on Terror.â€ Fellow West Pointer Gen. Wesley Clark as former NATO commander during the final Clinton years, was responsible for following orders to bomb and â€œbalkanizeâ€ Yugoslavia into 13 emaciated, highly weakened nation-states, some to soon become anti-Russian NATO members. But about ten days after 9/11, Ret. Gen. Clark learned during a Pentagon visit of the ambitious US neocon plan to overthrow seven countries in five years â€“ Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Iran, again by no accident all central bank holdouts. War criminal Clark belatedly, partially redeemed himself in 2007 when he finally broke the news of this heinous imperialistic US Empire agenda that by then successfully waged illegal coups in six of the seven listed countries. The only nation still left intact that Israel and US as the earthâ€™s only true terrorist states and now deemed genocidal world pariahs, have failed to topple and destroy is Iran. And that final nation now finds itself squarely in the Israel-US-Trump crosshairs.

This historical background provides the vitally important context necessary to understand and discern who todayâ€™s real villains are, and see through the nonstop false propaganda that always precedes the elitesâ€™ next antihuman divide and rule war in the same way that the legacy media incessantly calls Russiaâ€™s intervention in Ukraine â€œan unprovoked invasionâ€ as yet another boldface lie.

Similar to this Middle East constructed conflagration, the US/Westâ€™s proxy war in Ukraine conveniently omits how the US/NATO jumpstarted the war back in 2014 with the Obama-Hillary-Victoria Nuland led illegal overthrow of a democratically elected leader Viktor Yanukovych, and back in 2008, the US openly invited Ukraine to be the next NATO member in direct violation of 1991â€™s infamous â€œnot one inch eastwardâ€ US/NATO lie. MSM propaganda never admits these basic underlying crucial facts, much less mention the 2014-15 Minsk Agreement backstab against Putin used to bide time for the US/NATOâ€™s financing Kievâ€™s neo-Nazi troop buildup purging 14,000 ethnic Russians living in the Donbass region even prior to Putinâ€™s Special Military Operation. The Russian operation in Donbass barely preceded a planned NATO-Ukraine invasion of Donbass. The timely Putin intervention was definitely provoked as Donbass leaders had sent an S-O-S emergency request for assistance from Moscow.

For more than a century, itâ€™s always been City of London Khazarian mafia (KM) directing its US/Western puppets to perpetrate relentless, unbroken, hostile provocations against these same Khazarian mafia groomed, financed and spawned now rising powers of the East â€“ Russia, Iran and China, forced for mutual survival as the Khazarian mafiaâ€™s controlled opposition to form a strong military-economic strategic alliance in order to counter and resist the US/West. The binding self-defense pact between Iran and Russia officially goes into signed full effect as of April 15th that includes Iranâ€™s acquisition of the Russian S-300 air defense system. Additionally, in response to Trumpâ€™s latest over-the-top provocations against Iran, Putin issued a grave warning of â€œcatastrophicâ€ consequences should Trump attack Iran.

All along during the last couple centuries, itâ€™s been the Khazarian mafia bloodlines not-so-hidden, divide-and-rule hand that singlehandedly creates virtually every major global conflict, chaos and war, by malignant design. Moreover, the next Third World War Armageddon is intent on destroying Western civilization as oligarchsâ€™ biggest deemed impediment standing in the way of finalizing KMâ€™s agenda â€“ a technocratic totalitarian one world government and absolute neo-feudal enslavement for the grossly thinned down human herd still left alive. After all, useless eating humans are neither wanted nor needed in todayâ€™s New World Order AI robotics rollout, bent on replacing the human species on our home planet earth.

Fast forward to the Wednesday March 19th bombastic warmonger Trumpâ€™s Truth Social post:

Tremendous damage has been inflicted upon the Houthi barbarians. Watch how it will get progressively worse â€” Itâ€™s not even a fair fight, and never will be. They will be completely annihilated!

Astute geopolitical analyst and fellow West Pointer I went to school with â€“ Ret. Col. Douglas MacGregor, recently said that the only way the US can root out the Houthi stronghold in Yemen is to launch a full force ground invasion, and even then, it could get bogged down like past US Middle East war occupation defeats. Anything short of that extreme measure, like current and years of prior US airstrikes, cannot and will not provide sufficient impact to significantly weaken much less destroy the seasoned, battle tested, highly resilient Houthi fighting capability. Likewise, since last August, Col. MacGregor both soberly warns that the United States is â€œunprepared for war on Iran.â€ Moreover, even the Houthis are wreaking havoc with hypersonic missiles targeting Israel and the Red Sea. Finally, MacGregor admits the likelihood that Trump will attack Iran at the behest of Israeli war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu is extremely likely.

But as US airstrikes escalated in recent days, so have the Houthi counterattacks. On Wednesday March 26th, per Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree, the USS Truman aircraft carrier group parked in the Red Sea since November 2024, a sitting duck dinosaur relic from past warfare, was reportedly struck by 18 Ansar Allah missiles and a drone at the â€œUSS Harry Truman and its accompanying warships.â€ For several hours the Houthi forces engaged in combat firing drones and missile strikes against US warships. Yemeni rebels also claimed to have attacked Israeli military sites in Jaffa.

On March 30th, again Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree claimed that in three separate attacks the Houthi air force and navy engaged in battles launching cruise missiles and drones at US warships. Though the US Navy denies it, the Houthis report that the E2 Hawkeye aircraft serving as the command and control center for the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier group was damaged. Also the Houthis reported on Tuesday April 1st, another US reconnaissance MQ-9 Reaper drone was shot down over northeastern Yemen.

After Tehran rejected Trumpâ€™s ultimatum threat of US going to war with Iran if it refuses to begin immediate talks to shut down its alleged nuclear development program that Trumpâ€™s own CIA director John Radcliffe and National Intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard last week both insist Iran does not possess, in the meantime, Trumpâ€™s rhetoric is ramping up daily. On Sunday March 30th, he told NBC News:

If they donâ€™t make a deal, I will bomb Iran, and it will be a bombing like the USA has never done on any country before.

This recent display of bullying belligerence and pure madness is obviously anything but the road to peace, and of course Trump knows this, yet he is undoubtedly submitting to his City of London blackmailing controllersâ€™ demands, determined to fulfill their masonic 1871 prophecy of WWIII Armageddon between Zionism and Islam. But Iran is not a weak nation that will submissively react to direct threats, knuckling under and caving into Trumpâ€™s pugnacious, thuggish pressures. Tehran has stated it is only willing to explore initiating backchannel dialogue, but out of both principle and pride, it refuses to submit to Trumpâ€™s brutish, aggressive, street gang tactics of attempted browbeating intimidation to insanely risk every human life on earth. An April 1st medium.com article logically warns:

The tensions between the USA and Iran will increase very rapidly in the coming days. Its impact will be felt worldwide â€” on oil prices, on your portfolio.

Meanwhile, this latest outrageously dangerous Trump thuggery inching closer to all-out world war against Iran and its Eastern allies comes as he is using the leased remote Indian Ocean island Diego Garcia to quietly assemble an unprecedented buildup of 7 of the total 19 strategic B2 stealth bombers as a US staging area to ostensibly launch major attacks in the Middle East on Iran and/or Yemen. In addition to the bombers, also deployed on the island 2400 miles away from the Iran target zone are eight B-52 regular strategic bombers/missile carriers, seven C-17 â€œGlobemaster IIIâ€ heavy transports, ten KC-135 â€œStratotankerâ€ aerial refueling tankers and at least one P-8 â€œPoseidonâ€ ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) platform. In other words, this is too costly and significant of an operation to be merely a show of force. On April 1st, the Telegraph reveals that Iranâ€™s military is currently mulling over whether to attack US war planes on Diego Garcia. War is fast descending on our immediate horizon.

Plus, with US naval, air force and ground forces in the Middle East region exceeding 50,000 troops, war appears imminent if not unavoidable. Based on these alarming latest developments, the globalist powerbrokers appear to be demanding the collapse and end of both America and Western civilization, as part of its longtime scheme for major Western depopulation by provoking the divide and rule Eastern adversaries Iran, Russia and China into a WWIII showdown. Within our recorded history of 5 to 6,000 years, humanity has never been more precariously closer to self-annihilation, all by malevolent design.

Trumpâ€™s current over-the-top, hawkish demeanor totally betrays both his American voters returning him to the White House as well as his repeated presidential vows from just a few weeks ago, referring to building his legacy as â€œpeacemaker and unifier.â€ A month ago, idiot Trump lied uttering these words:

Itâ€™s my hope that my greatest legacy will be as a peacemaker, not a conqueror, I donâ€™t want to be a conqueror.

Itâ€™s almost as if the latest octogenarian president is plagued with schizoid â€œJekyll and Hydeâ€ personality. Additionally, Trump is surrounded by his Zionist Synagogue of Satan zealots as US historyâ€™s most pro-Jewish, Israel First order-following warmongers ever assembled in Washington, ready to fight yet more Greater Israel Project wars for Satan. Trump is also arbitrarily using antisemitism and hate speech laws to criminalize dissent in America in clear violation of our First Amendment free speech and public right to peaceful protest. Deporting students on foreign visas who have committed no crimes is the latest dagger to Gulag Amerika.

Within 24 hours over the weekend, the US engaged in 65 airstrikes in Yemen alone while Trumpâ€™s intel director Tulsi Gabbard, apparently totally oblivious, on March 29th foolishly posts on X:

President Trump IS the President of Peace. He is ending bloodshed across the world and will deliver lasting peace in the Middle East.

While her idolatry for Trump in the above quote is overflowing, she also posted the equally deceitful Trump statement:

Every day, weâ€™re keeping our promises to the Muslim community. My administration is engaged in relentless diplomacy to forge a lasting PEACE in the Middle East, building on the historic Abraham Accord

Some kind of â€œlasting PEACE,â€ threatening to annihilate Yemen and Iran as members of the â€œMuslim community.â€ Before Gabbard hooked up with this snake oil salesman in orange face, she represented a rare, honest, fresh approach to American politics. But as a living sample of how power corrupts, contrast her current deception with her September 2018 interview:

It is absolutely outrageous that the United States has continued its support for years now for Saudi Arabiaâ€™s genocidal war in Yemen that has killed thousands and thousands of innocent Yemeni people and caused mass starvation.

Now sheâ€™s hypocritically all in supporting and committing the same protracted genocidal war crimes that she so self-righteously railed against a few years earlier. Again, power corrupts. With Trump and Tulsiâ€™s national security team/clown show still licking their incompetent wounds, reeling from their scandalous Signal group chat faux pas, Trump and his entire regime appear totally inept, lying and inconsistent as bumbling, stumbling, erratic administration flunkies, again with Trumpâ€™s own intel chiefs claiming Iran doesnâ€™t even have a nuclear program while their boss is ready to plunge humanity off the apocalyptic Armageddon endgame cliff. If it wasnâ€™t so perilous and life-threatening for all life forms on this planet, this clown show driving todayâ€™s news would easily be cast off as one big laughable joke. But no one will be laughing if weâ€™re all soon dead.

63,"As They Cry Out ""Peace And Safety"", All I See Is More War...",https://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/as-they-cry-out-peace-and-safety-all-i-see-is-more-war/,https://www.rt.com/russia/614485-ukraine-violate-ceasefire-trump/,said,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,3/21/2025,theeconomiccollapseblog.com,"As They Cry Out â€œPeace And Safetyâ€, All I See Is More Warâ€¦","They keep telling us that we have entered a time of peace, but more conflict just continues to erupt all over the globe. Israel has just resumed ground operations against Hamas, President Trump is threatening to keep bombing the Houthis until they are â€œcompletely annihilatedâ€, we are being told that â€œsomethingâ€™s going to happenâ€ with Iran very soon, and the very limited agreement between the Russians and the Ukrainians to avoid striking energy infrastructure did not even last 24 hours. Compared to last week, do we have more war or less war? Clearly, we have more war. So you will have to excuse me if I am skeptical of those that are crying out that a time of â€œpeace and safetyâ€ is now upon us.

The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was supposed to lead to a permanent resolution of the conflict.

But instead, the ceasefire is now dead and the war is back onâ€¦

The Israeli military said on Wednesday its forces have resumed ground operations in the central and southern Gaza Strip, as a second day of airstrikes killed at least 20 Palestinians, according to local health workers. The renewed ground operations come a day after more than 400 Palestinians were killed in airstrikes in one of the deadliest episodes since the beginning of the conflict, shattering a ceasefire that has largely held since January. The Israeli military said its operations have extended Israelâ€™s control over the Netzarim Corridor, which bisects Gaza, and were a â€œfocusedâ€ manoeuvre aimed at creating a partial buffer zone between the north and the south of the enclave.

Israel wants the remainder of the hostages to be released.

After all this time, Hamas is still refusing to do that.

One Israeli official is warning that if Hamas continues to hold on to the hostages, military operations will escalate â€œto the point of total warâ€â€¦

â€œWeâ€™re in a new phase of the conflict,â€ the official said. â€œFrom here we either move forward with developments towards the release of additional hostages â€“ which is a major goal â€“ or thereâ€™ll be consistent escalations to the point of total war,â€ the official said.

Meanwhile, the U.S. is now at war with the Houthis in Yemen.

During the last administration, Joe Biden would lightly strike the Houthis once in a while, but now President Trump is pledging that â€œthe Houthi barbariansâ€ will be â€œcompletely annihilatedâ€â€¦

Reports are coming in that while Iran has lessened its intensity on Military Equipment and General Support to the Houthis, they are still sending large levels of Supplies. Iran must stop the sending of these Supplies IMMEDIATELY. Let the Houthis fight it out themselves. Either way they lose, but this way they lose quickly. Tremendous damage has been inflicted upon the Houthi barbarians, and watch how it will get progressively worse â€” Itâ€™s not even a fair fight, and never will be. They will be completely annihilated!

A few days earlier, U.S. Secretary of State told CBS News that we are â€œdoing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guysâ€â€¦

â€œWeâ€™re doing the entire world a favor by getting rid of these guys and their ability to strike global shipping. Thatâ€™s the mission here, and it will continue until thatâ€™s carried out,â€ he said. â€œThat never happened before. The Biden administration didnâ€™t do that. All the Biden administration would do is they would respond to an attack. These guys would launch one rocket. Weâ€™d hit the rocket launcher. Thatâ€™s it.â€

What kind of a military campaign will be required to completely eliminate the Houthis?

I would encourage everyone out there to seriously consider the answer to that question.

The last time I checked, the U.S. Constitution requires congressional approval before we declare war on someone.

Of course we are rapidly getting close to a major war with Iran as well.

During a recent discussion with reporters, President Trump promised that â€œsomethingâ€™s going to happen very soonâ€â€¦

As Iran nears the finish line to obtain nuclear weapons, US President Trump is warning that the world is down to its â€œfinal momentsâ€ to intervene. While expressing his preference for a peace deal over military action, Trump maintained that significant developments are imminent. â€œU.S. President Donald Trump hinted [earlier this month] that the United States could take military action against the Iranian nuclear program â€˜very soonâ€™ if the Islamic Republic does not strike a deal with the United States,â€ The Jewish News Syndicate (JNS) reported. â€œSpeaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said that there would be â€˜interesting days aheadâ€™ with respect to Iran.â€ President Trump went on to tell reporters: â€œWeâ€™re down to final strokes with Iran. Weâ€™re down to the final moments. Weâ€™re at the final moments. Canâ€™t let them have a nuclear weapon. We have a situation with Iran that somethingâ€™s going to happen very soonâ€”very, very soon. Hopefully, we could have a peace deal. Iâ€™m not speaking out of strength or weakness. Iâ€™m just saying, Iâ€™d rather see a peace deal than the other, but the other will solve the problem.â€

Iran has already said that there will be no deal.

So it is just a matter of time before the bombing of Iran begins, and then we will officially be at war with the Iranians.

But at least we are close to a peace deal with the Russians, right?

Actually, no we are not.

Less than 24 hours after President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to end attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days, the Ukrainians launched a drone attack against a Russian oil transfer facilityâ€¦

Less than 24 hours later, Russia has accused Ukraine of already breaking the Trump agreement. Russiaâ€™s defense ministry on Wednesday said Ukraine attack an oil transfer facility in Russiaâ€™s Krasnodar Region that services an international pipeline operation partially owned by American investors. The ministry described that the overnight attack saw three kimikaze drones target the site near the village of Kavkazskaya. The site transfers crude to a pipeline operated by the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), an international firm which has among its partners US giants Chevron and Mobil, Russiaâ€™s RT notes. The drone impact reportedly set fire to an oil reservoir, which has reportedly taken emergency crews a long time to extinguish. Local reports say crews are still battling the blaze.

In response, the Russians bombed energy infrastructure in the Ukrainian city of Slovyanskâ€¦

Russian forces have bombed a key piece of Ukraine energy infrastructure just hours after Vladimir Putin told Donald Trump he would halt attacks on the grid. Slovyansk, a city in the Donetsk region, was targeted according to local reports, leaving part of the city without electricity.

There had been hope that an agreement not to attack energy infrastructure could be a step toward a broader deal.

But the truth is that the two sides are light years apart from agreeing to any sort of a permanent deal.

The Russians are insisting that the four eastern territories that the Russians have annexed are now a part of Russia foreverâ€¦

Russiaâ€™s privately owned Kommersant business newspaper reports that President Putin is pushing his US counterpart to grant recognition of Russiaâ€™s annexation of the four territories in exchange for a pledge not to seize more land. Kommersant says that Putin is fundamentally arguing that â€œthereâ€™s no taking back what Russia has gainedâ€ â€“ and that the eastern territories are now permanently part of the Russian Federation.

On the other side, â€œPresident Zâ€ is demanding that the Russians return all Ukrainian territory that has been captured in exchange for a dealâ€¦

In a press conference with President Stubb of Finland in Helsinki today, the Ukrainian president said: â€˜Weâ€™re fighting for our sovereignty and our independence â€” weâ€™ll win this war.â€™ Zelensky drew clear red lines for peace, insisting that his nation would not accept territorial losses as part of a peace deal, and that the return of â€˜thousandsâ€™ of prisoners held in Russia was â€˜unconditionalâ€™.

The Russians arenâ€™t going to give the territory that they have captured back.

Anyone that thinks that is going to happen is just being delusional.

The Russians are winning the war and they are constantly gobbling up even more territory.

Any peace agreement must reflect the reality on the ground.

Since the Ukrainians and our European allies are not willing to accept that, I am convinced that there will be no permanent agreement.

But if these negotiations fail, this conflict will almost certainly go to an entirely new level.

During an interview with Laura Ingraham, President Trump admitted that U.S. forces could potentially end up being involved if a deal with Russia cannot be reachedâ€¦

Trump suggested that his push for a broader cease-fire is rooted in keeping US forces out of a potentially larger conflict. â€œLook, weâ€™re doing this â€“ there are no Americans involved. There could be if you end up in World War III over this, which is so ridiculous,â€ the president explained. â€œBut, you know, strange things happen,â€ he warned.

I certainly hope that â€œstrange thingsâ€ do not happen.

Most Americans would like to see peace in the Middle East and most Americans would like to see peace with Russia.

But instead we just keep getting more war.

We have been warned about what will happen if we keep going down this road.

Once someone decides to start using nuclear weapons, we could potentially see millions of people die.

One explosion is all it is going to take for everyone to put their fingers on their triggers.

If we were smart, we would be racing toward peace.

Unfortunately, for now we are steamrolling in the opposite direction.

By Russia Today

For over a month, protests have been taking place in cities across Slovakia, where demonstrators brandishing the slogan â€œSlovakia is Europeâ€ (which suspiciously echoes a similar phrase used during the Euromaidan protests in Ukraine in 2014) are calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Ficoâ€™s government.

The controversial figure of Fico, who survived an assassination attempt by a pro-Ukrainian activist in May 2024, has sparked divisions within the European Union. His views on Russia largely diverge from the European mainstream. In December, he traveled to Moscow to discuss with President Vladimir Putin the implications of Kievâ€™s cessation of Russian gas transit to the West. He has halted military assistance to Ukraine, criticized EU sanctions against Russia, and opposes Ukraineâ€™s NATO membership.

RT spoke with Lubos Blaha, vice-president of Ficoâ€™s Smer party and a member of the European Parliament, about the situation his country finds itself in.

RT: Robert Fico accused the opposition of orchestrating a Maidan-style uprising and attempting a coup. Do you believe foreign actors could be involved in this? And if so, who could it be?

Lubos Blaha: I probably wonâ€™t say anything new by stating that these color revolutions are exact copies of each other; they are completely identical and created from the same blueprint. Itâ€™s a complex and tested methodology, and if you dig a little deeper, youâ€™ll see that in all these cases, the clues lead to foreign countries. Well-known journalist Pepe Escobar often uses the phrase â€œusual suspectsâ€ when talking about these figures, and I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any need to elaborate further. Anyone who isnâ€™t completely blinded or paid to remain ignorant should understand whatâ€™s happening.

RT: How do you assess the likelihood of a no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Fico, which the opposition has threatened? Does the Smer party have a contingency plan in case they succeed?

Lubos Blaha: It would be unfortunate if this government dedicated to national self-preservation were to collapse due to traitors, but I believe that wonâ€™t happen. Even if it did happen, however, it wouldnâ€™t spell disaster for Slovakia, as a significant portion of the population has common sense. Weâ€™re not in the 1980s or 1990s anymore, and more people are realizing that a progressive coup wouldnâ€™t lead to anything good. Slovakia has no viable alternative except for a coalition of patriotic and socially responsible parties.

Fortunately, the globalist progressive opposition is helping us in this regard. What they propose as an alternative to Robert Ficoâ€™s government is such desperate and empty hysteria devoid of any political program, that it feels like theyâ€™re even less politically capable than their Maidan colleagues in other countries.

RT: Not long ago, Vladimir Zelensky commented on Michal Simeckaâ€™s visit to Kiev with the words, â€œWaiting for one leader, but another arrived.â€ How did Smer respond to this statement? Does this mean that Ukraine is interfering in Slovakiaâ€™s internal affairs? If so, what countermeasures could Smer take?

Lubos Blaha: I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s worthwhile to comment on the words of someone who isnâ€™t the legitimate president of Ukraine, or to take them seriously. Indeed, he doesnâ€™t hide his goal of interfering in Slovakiaâ€™s internal affairs and overthrowing the democratically elected government to bring to power individuals like himself â€” quislings loyal to the Biden wing of the American establishment.

If external attempts to influence events in Slovakia continue, we will respond as befits a sovereign state. I should add that we will never step away from the realm of democratic politics and the rule of law, we will be consistent and uncompromising in that commitment.

RT: What potential solutions to the gas transit crisis does your party foresee?

Lubos Blaha: I would clarify that this isnâ€™t a gas transit crisis; itâ€™s an attempt by Zelensky to ensure that Russian gas is no longer used in Europe, forcing Europeans to purchase more expensive American gas instead. This involves not just halting transit, but also regular attempts to physically destroy the infrastructure for exporting Russian gas to Europe, including the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines.

There are several potential ways out of this situation, but itâ€™s difficult to predict solutions in advance since the circumstances in Europe and Ukraine are evolving, and outcomes can vary. Europe will have gas, thereâ€™s no question about that. The question is, who will benefit from gas supplies to the EU? Currently, Russian gas is flowing into Slovakia via the TurkStream pipeline and the Balkans. However, I believe that common sense will ultimately prevail, and one day the reliable infrastructure established in Ukraine and Slovakia for supplying gas to Europe will be utilized again, benefiting all parties involved.

RT: According to NMS Market Research Slovakia, support for the Smer party is declining among the Slovak population. What do you think is behind this trend, and can the party regain voter trust before the next election cycle?

Lubos Blaha: With all due respect to the surveys conducted by such agencies, the Smer party (Direction â€“ Social Democracy) has been steadfastly pursuing principled policies for 25 years, and we will continue to do so. This commitment has been the foundation of our success, making us the most successful political party in modern Slovak history, thatâ€™s why weâ€™re not afraid of the future. Our opponents have often claimed that the end of Smer was near, that we were fading into oblivion, yet here we are. I must emphasize: today there is no real alternative to the patriotic coalition led by Robert Fico in Slovakia, and I have no doubt that the next election will confirm this.

RT: The year 2024 was significant for many EU countries in terms of elections. While Slovakia experienced a smooth election process with Peter Pellegrini being elected president, neighboring Romania annulled the results of the first round of elections. What does this situation say about the state of democratic institutions in the EU? Do you believe that such issues could become commonplace in the EU?

Lubos Blaha: I increasingly encounter individuals who say that the â€œgreat Westâ€ â€“ often portrayed to people in Eastern Europe as a model of functioning democracy and the rule of law â€“ only values these principles when itâ€™s convenient. However, when laws and democratic principles, i.e., the will of the majority, go against Western globalist elites who wield real power, they seem to lose their sensitivity to the rule of law and democracy. We observe similar trends in other EU countries. In France, Germany, Austria, and other EU member states, we witness how globalist forces desperately try to prevent certain parties chosen by the people through democratic elections from coming to power. Yes, I fear that as the European political landscape gradually and inexorably shifts in favor of patriotic and anti-globalist forces, we will see an increasing number of shameful, desperate, and even criminal attempts to reverse this trend.",2025-02-16 23:37:27+00:00,en,Real

The failure of Ukraineâ€™s counteroffensive, Russiaâ€™s victory over NATO in the â€œrace of logisticsâ€, the Westâ€™s prioritization of aid to Israel amidst its war with Hamas, US congressional dysfunction, and the upcoming election season have combined to create a crisis for NATOâ€™s proxy war on Russia through Ukraine. These analyses from late August onward will bring everyone up to speed about whatâ€™s happening if they havenâ€™t been closely following this New Cold War conflict in recent months:

* 18 August: â€œA Vicious Blame Game Is Breaking Out After The Counteroffensive Predictably Failedâ€

* 20 August: â€œUS Policymakers Are Caught In A Dilemma Of Their Own Making After The Failed Counteroffensiveâ€

* 25 August: â€œThe NYT & WSJâ€™s Critical Articles About Kievâ€™s Counteroffensive Explain Why It Failedâ€

* 3 September: â€œTop Canadian Media Revealed That Poor Medical Equipment Endangers One Million Ukrainian Troopsâ€

* 7 September: â€œPolandâ€™s Top Military Official Accidentally Discredited NATO On Several Countsâ€

* 9 September: â€œWaPo Reported That Ukrainians Are Distrustful Of The West & Flirting With A Ceasefireâ€

* 14 September: â€œWhy Was Zelensky Overly Defensive In His Latest Interview With The Economist?â€

* 14 September: â€œThe New York Times Confirmed That Russia Is Far Ahead Of NATO In The Race Of Logisticsâ€

* 31 October: â€œTime Magazine Shared Some â€˜Politically Inconvenientâ€™ Truths About Ukraineâ€

* 3 November: â€œUkraineâ€™s Commander-In-Chief Made A Last-Ditch Appeal For American Aidâ€

* 5 November: â€œThe New York Times Wants Everyone To Know About The Growing Zelensky-Zaluzhny Rivalryâ€

* 8 November: â€œThe Latest Reports Suggest That Secret Talks Are Taking Place Between The US & Russiaâ€

* 14 November: â€œThe Western Public Should Heed The Former NATO Supreme Commanderâ€™s Words About Ukraineâ€

* 19 November: â€œZelensky Is Desperate To Preemptively Discredit Potentially Forthcoming Protests Against Himâ€

And hereâ€™s a spree of reports from over the past few days showing how much everything has changed:

* 16 November: â€œEnd â€˜magical thinkingâ€™ about defeating Russia â€“ US expertsâ€

* 16 November: â€œUS Abrams tanks made no difference â€“ Zelenskyâ€

* 17 November: â€œZelensky fears a new â€˜Maidanâ€™ â€“ Bloombergâ€

* 17 November: â€œBiden signs funding bill that excludes Ukraineâ€

* 18 November: â€œBidens welcomed the Russians â€“ deputy PMâ€

* 18 November: â€œZelenskyâ€™s top aide criticizes slow delivery of Western armsâ€

* 19 November: â€œUkraine must brace for loss of US support â€“ ex-ambassadorâ€

* 19 November: â€œBloomberg outlines how Russia has shrugged off sanctionsâ€

* 19 November: â€œTop Zelensky aide questions Ukraineâ€™s â€˜survivalâ€™â€

* 20 November: â€œTime running short for US military aid to Ukraine â€“ NBCâ€

* 20 November: â€œZelensky demands â€˜rapid changesâ€™â€

* 20 November: â€œUkraine â€˜utterly dependentâ€™ on US aid â€“ Treasury secretaryâ€

* 20 November: â€œSTAY OUT: Zelensky warns Ukraine generals that getting involved in politics puts countryâ€™s unity at riskâ€

* 20 November: â€œUkraine â€˜concernedâ€™ by Western push for Russia talks â€“ security chiefâ€

* 21 November: â€œNo â€˜silver bulletâ€™ for Ukraine â€“ Washingtonâ€

* 21 November: â€œUkraine in â€˜big troubleâ€™ â€“ ABC Newsâ€

That spree of reports adds credence to the assessment that this proxy war appears to be winding down.

The top takeaways are that: 1) Western financial and military aid is indeed evaporating; 2) Ukraine is now freaking out and fearmongering about the future; 3) political rivalries in that country are intensifying; 4) the West is indeed pressuring Ukraine to enter into peace talks with Russia aimed at freezing the conflict; and 5) organic grassroots protests might break out across Ukraine sometime soon. This isnâ€™t how everything was supposed to be, however, since Kiev promised an altogether different future.

It seems like so long ago, but just six months back the West was hyping everyone up about what to expect from Kievâ€™s then-upcoming counteroffensive, which was supposed to be a Clausewitzian masterstroke that would showcase the Westâ€™s military superiority. Instead of Russian being chased back into its pre-2014 borders, however, the New York Times admitted in late September that â€œRussia now controls nearly 200 square miles more territory in Ukraine compared with the start of the year.â€

Quite clearly, that one country on its own was able to withstand the proxy war onslaught of the â€œmore than 50 nationsâ€ that Biden recently boasted had joined the US in arming Ukraine. Even against those odds, it was ultimately Russia â€“ and not Ukraine â€“ that successfully launched its own counteroffensive by expanding the area under its control by 200 square miles. Western stockpiles have been depleted and whatâ€™s left is earmarked for Israel, however, so that metric might multiply by early next year.

If the front ends up collapsing in the opposite direction than the West expected would happen just half a year ago, then this New Cold War bloc might feel pressured to launch a conventional on-the-ground intervention to safeguard some of the gains that its people paid over $160 billion to secure. In that scenario, the risk of World War III breaking out by miscalculation would spike, which no responsible policymaker wants to have happen. After all, for as radical as the Western elite is, itâ€™s not suicidal.

Russia is also aware of whatâ€™s at stake if it manages to achieve a breakthrough across the coming months should the front collapse as a result of Ukraineâ€™s multidimensional troubles, which is why it appears to still be committed to President Putinâ€™s strong signals from this summer about negotiating peace. So long as Zelensky refuses to comply with his Western patronsâ€™ demands in this respect, however, the abovementioned scenario will remain credible and could materialize sooner than later.

Therein lies the significance of his growing rivalry with Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny. Ukraineâ€™s top military official could either orchestrate a military coup with the Westâ€™s approval â€“ irrespective of whether it follows the outbreak of organic grassroots protests â€“ or be deposed by Zelensky with their approval as a reward for recommencing meaningful peace talks with Russia in some capacity. However it unfolds, Zaluzhny is expected to play a major role in the coming months, whether as a â€œheroâ€ or â€œvillainâ€.

Considering all the disadvantageous dynamics that are rapidly converging nowadays, thereâ€™s little doubt that NATOâ€™s proxy war on Russia is winding down, though that doesnâ€™t automatically mean that the conflict will soon freeze. Itâ€™ll likely continue even if only at a low scale as peace talks, including potentially secret ones, take place (unless the omnipotent threat of a black swan materializes). For all intents and purposes, however, this proxy war will probably be fought at a different tempo from now on.

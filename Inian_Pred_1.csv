55,Coronavirus: The UN secretary wants a global cease-fire amid pandemic,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/04/28/coronavirus-un-secretary-wants-global-cease-fire-amid-pandemic/5163972002/,https://www.unian.info/war/10932227-mp-ukraine-asks-russia-via-osce-to-ensure-full-ceasefire-in-donbas-amid-coronavirus-crisis.html,Ukraine,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,1/6/2025,usatoday.com,'War and disease travel together': Why the pandemic push for a global cease-fire is gaining ground,"WASHINGTON â€“ When the head of the United Nations first called for a â€œglobal cease-fireâ€ on March 23, it seemed like a quixotic quest that would fall on the deaf ears of warring guerrillas, militant terrorists and belligerent governments across the globe.

But over the past month, fighters from Colombia to Ukraine have signaled a willingness to put down their weapons as the world confronts a deadly pandemic that could devastate civilian populations and armies alike.

The 15-member U.N. Security Council may vote as early as this week on a resolution that demands an â€œimmediate cessation of hostilities in all countries on its agendaâ€ and calls for armed groups to engage in a 30-day cease-fire, according to a draft of the measure obtained by USA TODAY.

Its fate is uncertain, and experts say it comes with many caveats and exceptions â€“ including a loophole that could allow Russia to continue bombing civilians in Syria.

Right now, world powers are still quibbling over several provisions. The Trump administration has objected to any language expressing support for the World Health Organization, among other provisions â€“ disputes that could sink or stall the effort. President Donald Trump has blasted the WHO being biased toward China and accepting Beijing's statements about the coronavirus outbreak at face value.

A State Department official declined to comment on the draft, citing ongoing negotiations. The official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the Trump administration supports the call for a global cease-fire but wants to ensure it will not hinder U.S. counterterrorism missions.

If it passes, experts say its impact could be significant â€“ albeit not sweeping â€“ during an otherwise bleak moment of global crisis.

â€œThis is not a piece of paper thatâ€™s going to save the planet, and itâ€™s not even going to stop some of the nasty wars that are burning out there,â€ said Richard Gowan, an expert on the United Nations and peacekeeping with the International Crisis Group, a nonpartisan organization that seeks to prevent conflict.

â€œBut itâ€™s at least something which could help ease middle-sized and smaller conflicts in countries ranging from Colombia to Sudan, where we know that armed groups are actually interested in pausing violence and talking about peace during the COVID crisis.â€

It could also help staunch the flow of refugees in some war-ravaged countries â€“ and thus slow the spread of COVID-19, said Barry Posen, an international professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

""War and disease travel together and are usually causative,"" Posen said.

While a global cease-fire may sound lofty and idealistic, he said, it's also quite practical, particularly in places like Syria and Yemen, where health care is scarce and civilians are extremely vulnerable to disease.

""The intrusion of COVID into that situation would make what's already a horror show into an even bigger horror show,"" he said. ""If you can do a little something to suppress these wars at the moment, you would also be doing a little something to suppress the disease."" And because these conflicts are also producing refugees, it could help limit the further spread of the illness if civilians are not forced to flee conflict zones.

U.S. coronavirus map: Tracking the outbreak

More than 100 countries, 16 armed groups already endorse cease fire

The United Nation's secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, has used both lofty rhetoric and harsh reality in his pitch for the cease-fire.

""There should be only one fight in our world today: our shared battle against COVID-19,"" he said in an April 3 news briefing on his effort. French President Emmanuel Macron has also championed the cease-fire proposal.

So far, about 16 armed groups and more than 100 countries have endorsed the measure, according to an informal tally kept by U.N. officials. A few examples:

â€¢ In Colombia, a left-wing rebel group known as the ELN agreed to a cease-fire starting April and said it would consider reviving peace talks with the government.

â€¢ In Yemen, one side of that brutal war â€“ the Saudi Arabia-led coalition â€“ agreed to a unilateral cease-fire for at least a month, to help control the spread of coronavirus in a country already ravaged by starvation and other diseases. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have not yet signed on.

â€¢ In Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces agreed to a cease-fire, saying its fighters would defend themselves against attacks but not engage in offensive military action. â€œWe hope that this humanitarian truce will help to open the door for dialogue and political solution and to put an end to the war in the world and Syria,â€ the SDF said in a statement.

Guterres hailed these moves but noted there is ""a huge distance between declarations and deeds.""

P. Terrance Hopmann, a professor of international relations at Johns Hopkins University, said there's a stark power imbalance among those who have signed onto the cease-fire proposal and those who have not â€“ with rebel groups far more willing to end fighting than they governments they are trying to topple.

""Rebels don't have access to hospitals, they don't have access to medical care generally,"" he noted. ""They're often in the jungle or the desert or something.""

What does coronavirus do to your body?: Everything to know about the infection

Governments, even those under attack, may see an advantage in the pandemic ""because they already have a power asymmetry in their favor"" and therefore may try to push forward to try to win a conflict rather than negotiate a truce, he said.

One surprising exception is in the Philippines, Hopmann said, where a communist rebel group said it had ordered its fighters to observe a cease-fire amid the pandemic after Philippine's hard-line president, Rodrigo Duterte, had declared his own unilateral cease-fire. The conflict has caused an estimated 40,000 deaths in that country.

""We'll be lucky if this appeal works in one or two cases,"" Hopmann said. ""But if it does,

it would be a significant accomplishment because thousands of people were being killed every day in many conflicts around the world.""

Cease-fire pitch comes as peace talks become difficult amid social distancing

Gowan noted that the push for a cease-fire comes as U.N. mediators and envoys cannot travel to conflict zones, making peace talks even more difficult. He also said some groups that have endorsed the cease-fire have already started fighting again, while others have less-than-altruistic motives.

""In Yemen, the Saudis have for some time been trying to see if they can find a way to get out of this quagmire,"" Gowan said, and the pandemic may offer ""a face-saving way"" to exit a war that has damaged the kingdom's reputation and drained its military.

But even as the Saudis embraced the U.N. proposal, another faction on Monday broke a peace deal it had signed in November, highlighting the intractability of the multicountry conflict.

Gowan said the peace push may gain more traction as the pandemic spreads.

""In places like Libya and eastern Ukraine, where fighting goes on, the disease hasnâ€™t had its full effect yet in terms of infections or economic damage,"" he said. ""As the disease plays out, youâ€™re going to see more military groups really feel the pain to resources and fighters ... and that could inspire a sense of exhaustion that might inspire more countries to take this seriously.""

For major world powers, Posen said the coronavirus outbreaks on the USS Theodore Roosevelt and a French aircraft carrier should serve as a stark warning about how the disease could weaken military prowess. In both cases, hundreds of sailors became infected as the virus swept through the ships.

""The disease caused by the coronavirus is weakening all of the great and middle powers more or less equally,"" he said. He said with no country likely to gain a meaningful military advantage from the pandemic, ""the odds of a war between major powers will go down, not up.""

That doesn't mean the U.S. and its foes aren't flirting with conflict. After a dozen Iranian speed boats brazenly swarmed U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf, Trump last week threatened to ""shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.""

Gowan and others said the Trump administration has objected to at least two elements of the resolution. U.S. officials are pushing for language calling for ""transparency"" about the origins of the virus, which first emerged in China, and they are fighting supportive language for the World Health Organization, which Trump has accused of mishandling the pandemic and favoring China in its public statements.

The draft resolution currently has a placeholder provision on the WHO: ""compromise related to the language on WHO to be decided at the end of the negotiation,"" it reads.",4/28/2020 0:00,en,Real

Achtung Realsatire, die Tagesschau macht Handstand auf der Zunge: â€œMilitÃ¤rische Auseinandersetzungen sind fÃ¼r Russland seit Jahren ein bewÃ¤hrtes Mittel, sich Geltung und Mitsprache zu verschaffenâ€, behauptet sie frech, obwohl die Politik mit Bomben und Granaten doch das Markenzeichen der USA ist. Die Spitzenjournalisten der ARD-aktuell fÃ¼hlen sich halt Ã¼ber alle Fakten erhaben. Sogar darÃ¼ber, dass Propaganda besonders dann wirkt, wenn sie die Wahrheit bloÃŸ verbiegt und nicht komplett ignoriert. Im vorliegenden Fall wirft ihr Stuss zudem die Frage auf, seit wann es denn den USA und ihren NATO-Kriegskameraden zusteht, anderen VÃ¶lkern Mitsprache und Geltung zu gewÃ¤hren oder zu versagen. Nicht â€žder Russeâ€œ, sondern die â€žWestliche Wertegemeinschaftâ€œ versucht, alle unbotmÃ¤ÃŸigen LÃ¤nder unter ihre Fuchtel zu zwingen, mit erpresserischen Sanktionen oder â€“ falls sie sich militÃ¤risch Ã¼berlegen fÃ¼hlt â€“ mit mÃ¶rderischem Angriffskrieg.



Man muss das Offensichtliche ja nicht immer wieder aufzeigen und nachweisen. Belassen wir es also bei dem Einwurf, dass nicht nur der Irak, Syrien und Libyen Zeugnis ablegen fÃ¼r die Rechtlosigkeit, Infamie und Unmenschlichkeit des Weltherrschers USA und seiner Vasallen. Die zahllosen Kriege der â€žWestlichen Wertegemeinschaftâ€œ und deren vernichtende Sanktionspolitik haben noch weniger mit demokratischen und humanitÃ¤ren Idealen zu tun als die mittelalterlichen KreuzzÃ¼ge mit GlaubensstÃ¤rke und christlicher NÃ¤chstenliebe.

Der Wertewesten, wir Guten, wir fÃ¤lschen die Geschichte lieber, statt ihre Lehren zu beherzigen; aufs gleiche Recht fÃ¼r alle und auf die VorzÃ¼ge der friedlichen Koexistenz pfeifen wir jederzeit, wenn es im Interesse der USA liegt. Denen dient die deutsche Bundesregierung nÃ¤mlich besonders gerne. Kanzlerin Merkel findet dafÃ¼r die immer passende Rechtfertigung: Die transatlantischen Beziehungen seien ein zentraler Pfeiler in der AuÃŸen- und Sicherheitspolitik, der im ureigenen Interesse erhalten werden mÃ¼sse. WÃ¶rtlich

â€žWir sollten nie vergessen, dass Europa nicht neutral ist, Europa ist Teil des politischen Westens.â€œ

Tja, Pech gehabt, Freunde, wir sind nicht neutral und friedlich. Ãœbrigens: Geografisch gehÃ¶rt auch Russland zu Europa, aber damit berÃ¼hren wir schon eine Wurzel des Unfriedens: Russland will sich nicht von der NATO-EU vereinnahmen und als Teil dieses â€žpolitischen Westensâ€œ (Merkel) von US-Kapitalisten ausbeuten lassen. Deshalb gilt Russland, wie die Volksrepublik China, wie der Iran und etliche andere â€žBÃ¶seâ€œ, als Feind. Und darum bleibt Merkel bei ihrer transatlantisch verdrehten Logik: Wenn sich â€žEuropaâ€œ in der Welt behaupten wolle, mÃ¼sse es

â€žsein Schicksal stÃ¤rker in die eigene Hand nehmen und gleichzeitig als verlÃ¤sslicher Partner der westlichen Werte- und Interessengemeinschaft agieren.â€œ (ebd.)

Es wÃ¤re zum Lachen, wenn diese Ignoranz gegenÃ¼ber der Geschichte (die Sowjetunion und China waren Opfer, nicht TÃ¤ter!) nicht zum Heulen wÃ¤re.

Zu viel auf dem Kerbholz

An der gegenwÃ¤rtig wieder verstÃ¤rkt feindseligen Ausrichtung Deutschlands gegen Russland und China beteiligt sich selbstredend auch ARD-aktuell, indem die Redaktion die aggressive Politik des Westens verschleiert. Sie wirkt daran mit, den neuen/alten â€žFeindenâ€œ all das Ãœbel anzudichten, mit dem sich der Westen selbst hervortut. Der mÃ¶rderische Putsch in Kiew, obwohl von den USA, der NATO und der EU organisiert, wurde zur â€žMaidan-Demokratiebewegungâ€œ umgelogen. Die Volksentscheide der mehrheitlich russischen Krimbewohner, ihre Halbinsel wieder mit Russland zu vereinen, zu dem die Krim seit Katharina der GroÃŸen gehÃ¶rt, werden mit der Keule â€žAnnexion der Krimâ€œ aus dem GedÃ¤chtnis getilgt, ohne RÃ¼cksicht auf die Fakten und auf russisches Geschichtsbewusstsein und Kulturtradition. Der Krieg der Ukro-Nazis gegen die Donbass-Republiken wird als Verteidigung gegen russische Okkupationsabsichten ausgegeben. Der Konsens des Abkommens von Minsk (2015) ist lÃ¤ngst vergessen.

Kein Wort verlor die Tagesschau bisher darÃ¼ber, dass die USA und ihr ergebenster Kriegsknecht, die Bundesrepublik Deutschland, weiterhin Truppen im Irak stationieren, unter Bruch des VÃ¶lkerrechts und entgegen dem Willen des Parlaments und der Regierung in Bagdad. Sie schweigt beharrlich Ã¼ber den deutschen Anteil am VÃ¶lkerrechtsbruch bei der Besetzung und Bombardierung Nordsyriens. Erst recht darÃ¼ber, dass die Bundesluftwaffe sich an Kriegsverbrechen beteiligte, z.B. in Der-Es-Zur, indem ihre Tornado-AufklÃ¤rer der US-Air-Force die Zieldaten fÃ¼r das sorgfÃ¤ltig geplante Massaker beschafften.

Die Auflistung fundamentaler journalistischer RegelverstÃ¶ÃŸe der Tagesschau lieÃŸe sich beliebig fortsetzen. Stichworte: Venezuelas Hampelmann-â€žPrÃ¤sidentâ€œ GuaidÃ³, Israels Landraub in PalÃ¤stina, die Psy-Ops um die Skripals, um Nawalny und den Berliner Tiergarten-Mord, die Einmischung des Westens in Belarus, die Krawallstories Ã¼ber die Uiguren in China, die angeblich russischen Cyber-Angriffe auf den Bundestag, undsoweiter, undsoweiterâ€¦

LÃ¼ckenhafte Nachrichten

Am 28. Juni begann das zweiwÃ¶chige ManÃ¶ver â€žSea Breezeâ€ (Seebrise) der USA-gefÃ¼hrten Werte-Allianz im Schwarzen Meer. Mit 32 beteiligten LÃ¤ndern aus allen Kontinenten, 5000 Soldaten, 32 Kriegsschiffen, 40 Kampfflugzeugen sowie 18 Spezialtrupps und Taucherteams ist es die bisher grÃ¶ÃŸte derartige Ãœbung direkt vor der russischen KÃ¼ste. ARD-aktuell berichtete darÃ¼ber, erklÃ¤rte jedoch mit keinem Wort den ManÃ¶ver-Gegenstand, die angenommene Lage, das sogenannte â€žSzenarioâ€œ. Und: Sie lieÃŸ unerwÃ¤hnt, dass neben den USA ausgerechnet die Ukraine eine FÃ¼hrungsfunktion im ManÃ¶ver hat.

Die Ukraine ist (noch) kein Mitglied der NATO. GeÃ¼bt wird auch nicht Selbstverteidigung gemÃ¤ÃŸ NATO-Statut. Deshalb machte die US-Botschaft in Kiew auf harmlos: Man wolle ja nur â€ždie KompatibilitÃ¤t der StreitkrÃ¤fte verbessern, die Sicherheit auf See erhÃ¶hen und fÃ¼r Frieden in der Region sorgen.â€œ

Weniger heuchlerisch gibt die Zeitung â€žStar and Stripesâ€œ der US-StreitkrÃ¤fte zu, dass eine Machtdemonstration beabsichtigt ist:

â€žâ€¦ die USA und ihre VerbÃ¼ndeten haben die Vorbereitungen fÃ¼r Sea Breeze fortgesetzt, deren Ziel es ist, Moskau eine klare Botschaft zu senden, dass sie sich nicht einschÃ¼chtern lassen. â€¦ Wenn Moskau glaubt, dass wir in Kriegszeiten zusammenstehen und Ã¼ber genÃ¼gend militÃ¤rische Macht verfÃ¼gen â€¦ wird Russland abgeschreckt â€¦ gleichzeitig werden unsere VerbÃ¼ndeten, Partner und Freunde Mut fassen und sich selbstbewusst genug fÃ¼hlen, um sich den russischen Forderungen zu widersetzen.â€œ

Die Tagesschau und ihre Korrespondenten in Moskau und in Washington fragen aber nicht: Von welchen russischen Forderungen sehen sich denn â€ždie VerbÃ¼ndeten, Partner und Freunde der USAâ€œ gefÃ¤hrdet? Ist nicht vielmehr â€žSea Breezeâ€œ selbst eine aggressive Herausforderung, ein Ã¤uÃŸerst brisanter, abenteuerlich dummer Versuch, Russlands Hoheitsrechte mit einem mÃ¶glichst groÃŸen Heloten-Heer â€žeinzudÃ¤mmenâ€œ, wie auf dem NATO-Gipfel anno 2016 als politische Zielvorgabe ganz offiziell beschlossen?

Nieten am Regierungsruder

Eine Glanznummer in ebenso riskanter wie stupider militÃ¤rischer Provokation boten zum Auftakt die Briten, indem sie ihren ZerstÃ¶rer HMS â€žDefenderâ€œ in russische HoheitsgewÃ¤sser vor der Krim eindringen lieÃŸen. Und wieder vermied die Tagesschau sorgfÃ¤ltig und NATO-hÃ¶rig, uns mitzuteilen, was daran falsch war. Das britische Kriegsschiff verstieÃŸ gegen internationales Recht und konnte von russischer Marine und Luftwaffe nur mit WarnschÃ¼ssen und BombenabwÃ¼rfen zur KursÃ¤nderung gezwungen werden.

Von â€žjÃ¼ngster Kraftprobeâ€œ statt von Rechtsbruch und FriedensgefÃ¤hrdung war daraufhin die Rede, nicht nur auf tagesschau.de. Und obwohl es sich unbestreitbar um einen britischen Ãœbergriff handelte, war wieder der Russe schuld:

â€žEs ist nicht das erste Mal, dass Russland gegen das â€¦ ManÃ¶ver â€šSea Breezeâ€˜ Sturm lÃ¤uftâ€œ. (ebd.)

Gerade so, als wÃ¤re Moskau verpflichtet, sich das aggressive Verhalten der Briten widerspruchslos gefallen zu lassen.

â€žSea Breezeâ€œ ist kein ManÃ¶ver im Ã¼blichen Sinne. Es findet unter Berufung auf Verabredungen Washingtons mit Kiew im Jahr 1993 statt, zu einer Zeit, als in Moskau der versoffene Boris Jelzin den USA zu Willen war. Allerdings war damals noch Ã¼berhaupt keine Rede von enger Koordination der Ukraine mit der NATO. â€žSea Breezeâ€œ verfolgt indessen ausdrÃ¼cklich das Ziel,

â€ždie KompatibilitÃ¤t der ukrainischen StreitkrÃ¤fte mit denen der NATO-VerbÃ¼ndeten zu erhÃ¶hen.â€œ

Der britische ZerstÃ¶rer HMS â€žDefenderâ€œ war nicht die einzige dreiste Provokation im â€žSea Breezeâ€œ-Rahmen. Die niederlÃ¤ndische Fregatte HNLMS â€žEvertsenâ€œ nahm kurz darauf, ebenfalls ohne Russlands Erlaubnis, Kurs auf die â€žStraÃŸe von Kertschâ€œ, eine Meerenge Ã¶stlich der Krim. Erst russische SU-30-Jagdflugzeuge und SU-24-Bomber Ã¼berzeugten den Fregatten-KapitÃ¤n schlieÃŸlich, dass ein Richtungswechsel ratsam war.

ARD-aktuell vermeldete auch diese Begebenheit wie Ã¼blich einseitig, von HintergrÃ¼nden und Kontext bereinigt. AusfÃ¼hrlich gab sie das scheinheilige Gejammer der hollÃ¤ndischen Regierung wieder, die russischen Kampfjets hÃ¤tten die â€žEvertsenâ€œ bedrÃ¤ngt und â€žSchein-Attackenâ€œ geflogen. Sie hÃ¤tten auf der Fregatte â€žunverantwortliche StÃ¶rungen der Elektronikâ€œ bewirkt. Die russische Sichtweise wurde hingegen nur mit einem Satz bedacht.

Die Tagesschau lieÃŸ unerwÃ¤hnt, dass die NiederlÃ¤nder ja gewarnt sein mussten. Was ihnen widerfuhr, hatten die USA bereits vor sieben Jahren erlebt. Damals Ã¼berflog ein russischer SU-24-Bomber die USS â€žDonald Cookâ€œ im Schwarzen Meer und ruinierte das hochmoderne elektronische Kampfsystem â€žAegisâ€œ des mit Raketen bestÃ¼ckten ZerstÃ¶rers grÃ¼ndlich. Die â€žDonald Cookâ€œ hatte alle russischen Mahnungen ignoriert und gar zu frech Kurs auf die russischen KÃ¼stengewÃ¤sser genommen. Als wehrloser Kahn mit vollkommen desillusionierter Besatzung musste sie in einen rumÃ¤nischen Hafen flÃ¼chten.

Der hintergrÃ¼ndige Zweck der beiden jÃ¼ngsten hochriskanten Provokationen blieb unseren QualitÃ¤tsjournalisten natÃ¼rlich verborgen: Briten und NiederlÃ¤nder durchkreuzten damit den Plan des franzÃ¶sischen PrÃ¤sidenten Macron und der deutschen Kanzlerin Merkel, nach dem (unergiebigen) Biden-Putin-Treffen in Wien ein sinnvolleres EU-Gipfeltreffen mit dem russischen PrÃ¤sidenten zu veranstalten. Ihr Vorschlag stieÃŸ nicht nur auf den vorhersehbaren Widerstand Polens und der drei baltischen Staaten. Auch das EU-Mitglied Niederlande hielt dagegen. Das nicht-mehr-EU-Mitglied GroÃŸbritannien stÃ¤nkerte vom Rande her. Meldung nach Washington: EU-GipfelplÃ¤ne gekippt, Mission erfÃ¼llt.

Die Tagesschau ist zwar laut Rundfunkstaatsvertrag verpflichtet, Ã¼ber das Weltgeschehen umfassend und vollstÃ¤ndig zu unterrichten. Wie aber sollte die ARD-aktuell-Redaktion Ã¼ber etwas unterrichten, das sie sich selbst nicht zu kapieren gestattet?

Zurechtgebogene Wahrheit

Statt pflichtgemÃ¤ÃŸer Information spielte die Tagesschau also auch diesmal nur wieder die Platte mit der vÃ¶lkerrechtlichen Fehlinterpretation ab, Russland habe die Krim annektiert; die Briten hÃ¤tten daher keine russischen Hoheitsrechte verletzt, ihr Kriegsschiff â€žDefenderâ€œ habe nur ukrainisches Seegebiet vor der Krim durchfahren:

â€žFÃ¼r den Ã¼berwiegenden Teil der Weltgemeinschaft aber war und ist die Krim gemÃ¤ÃŸ dem VÃ¶lkerrecht weiter Bestandteil der Ukraine. Weshalb auch die Briten darauf verweisen, dass sich ihr Schiff in ukrainischen und nicht in russischen GewÃ¤ssern aufgehalten habe.â€œ (Anm. 13)

Erstens: â€žWeltgemeinschaftâ€œ ist ein transatlantischer Kampfbegriff. Er verschleiert, dass nur eine knappe Mehrheit, nÃ¤mlich 100 von 194 Staaten, die Krim im Jahr 2014 als weiterhin ukrainisch erklÃ¤rte; mehr als 50 Zwergstaaten hatten zu dieser Mehrheit beigetragen (u.a. Monaco, Tuvalu, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Malta, Nauru, San Marino, Palau, Marshallinseln). Der anspruchsvoll â€žÃ¼berwiegende Teil der Weltgemeinschaftâ€œ reprÃ¤sentiert nicht mal ein Drittel der WeltbevÃ¶lkerung. Zweitens: Anders, als ARD-aktuell zu suggerieren versucht, blieb das See-Recht von alldem unberÃ¼hrt. Die Russische FÃ¶deration wurde per UN-Resolution am 19. Dezember 2017 sogar ausdrÃ¼cklich aufgefordert,

â€žallen ihr als Besatzungsmacht aus dem anwendbaren VÃ¶lkerrecht erwachsenden Verpflichtungen nachzukommen.â€œ

Dazu gehÃ¶rt auch, dass Russland als â€žBesatzungsmachtâ€œ den Verkehr in den HoheitsgewÃ¤ssern rund um die Krim regulieren darf. Selbst deutsche Rechtsexperten erkennen diese ZustÃ¤ndigkeit an. Es spielt vÃ¶lkerrechtlich und (im hier diskutierten Fall) auch politisch Ã¼berhaupt keine Rolle, ob die Krim annektiert wurde oder ob sie sich frei und aus eigenen StÃ¼cken zum Wechsel nach Russland entschloss. Das Eindringen fremder Kriegsschiffe in die GewÃ¤sser rund um die Krim ist in jedem Falle illegal.

Es ist allerdings fÃ¼r ARD-aktuell typisch, dass sie ihrem Publikum solche korrekt einordnenden Informationen vorenthÃ¤lt und der plumpen britischen Provokation den Anschein von LegitimitÃ¤t verleiht. Russlands AuÃŸenpolitik soll, wo immer sich dazu MÃ¶glichkeiten bieten, als Gefahr fÃ¼r die Sicherheit Westeuropas dargestellt und diskreditiert werden. Das zeigt sich auch in einer anderen Bemerkung der Tagesschau:

â€žGleichzeitig lÃ¤sst das Land (Russland) bei einer Ãœbung im Ã¶stlichen Mittelmeer selbst die Muskeln spielen: schlieÃŸlich unterhÃ¤lt Russland in Syrien eine Marine- und Luftwaffenbasis. Bei der MilitÃ¤rÃ¼bung kommen auch Kampfflugzeuge zum Einsatz, die Ãœberschallraketen befÃ¶rdern kÃ¶nnen.â€œ (Anm.12)

Nicht alles, was hinkt, ist ein Vergleich. USA und NATO veranstalten weitab von ihren Zentralen, jedoch in nÃ¤chster NÃ¤he zu Russland, provokante MilitÃ¤rmanÃ¶ver in ohnehin schon gespannter AtmosphÃ¤re. Russland reagiert, aber nur nahe der eigenen Grenze bzw. im Hoheitsbereich Syriens, seines VerbÃ¼ndeten. Es handelt legitim, weil es Verteidigungsbereitschaft demonstriert und keine aggressive â€žEindÃ¤mmungâ€œ probt.

Die Schwadroneure haben das Wort

Die PropagandatrÃ¶ten der ARD-aktuell nehmen sich heraus, dies anzuzweifeln und von (bedrohlichen) russischen â€žMuskelspielenâ€œ zu schwadronieren. FÃ¼r Ignoranz und transatlantischen Konformismus der ARD-aktuell garantiert Sylvia StÃ¶ber, mit Sonderstatus in der ARD-aktuell-Unterabteilung â€žFaktenfinderâ€œ ausgestattet:

â€žInnenpolitisch sind die Berichte vom Schwarzen Meer dazu geeignet, von der Corona-Lage in Russland und den EinschrÃ¤nkungen nicht kremltreuer Politiker und BÃ¼rgerengagements vor der Duma-Wahl im September abzulenken: Putin prÃ¤sentiert sich stattdessen als Verteidiger Russlands.â€œ

Fakten, die die AggressivitÃ¤t des â€žWertewestensâ€œ, seine Feindbildmalerei und Kriegstreiberei belegen, fallen bei ARD-aktuell gerne untern Tisch. Die Tagesschau meldete folglich nicht, dass hinter einer Londoner Bushaltestelle Geheimpapiere gefunden und im Internet verÃ¶ffentlicht worden waren, die beweisen, dass Premier Boris Johnson seinen ZerstÃ¶rer HMS â€žDefenderâ€œ zu einer absichtlichen Provokation in die russischen HoheitsgewÃ¤sser geschickt hatte. Der Vorfall war kein Versehen, sondern Beweis fÃ¼r Johnsons unsÃ¤gliche Arroganz und chaotische Bedenkenlosigkeit.

Keine Silbe verliert ARD-aktuell natÃ¼rlich darÃ¼ber, dass auch unsere intellektuell nur bescheiden ausgestattete Kriegsministerin Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer gut fÃ¼r jedwede FriedensgefÃ¤hrdung im Schwarzen Meer ist. Zeitgleich mit der â€žDefenderâ€œ-Provokation lieÃŸ sie zwei Eurofighter des Taktischen Luftwaffengeschwaders 71 â€žRichthofenâ€œ vom ostfriesischen Heimatstandort Wittmund ans Schwarze Meer verlegen: nach RumÃ¤nien, auf den militÃ¤rischen Teil des Flughafens ConstanÈ›a. Sie sind dort in eine Alarmrotte der Royal Air Force integriert und sollen â€žim Ernstfall an der Seite der britischen Einheit schnellstmÃ¶glich handlungsbereitâ€œ sein.

Faktisch ist das eine deutsche Beteiligung an der â€žSea Breezeâ€œ-Provokation: Das ManÃ¶ver endet am 10. Juli, die Eurofighter der Bundesluftwaffe sollen am 9. Juli nach Wittmund heimkehren.

ARD aktuell wÃ¤re gut beraten, Ã¼ber die Warnung der russischen GeneralitÃ¤t zu berichten: â€žDer nÃ¤chste Eindringling in unsere HoheitsgewÃ¤sser wird versenkt.â€œ (Anm.18) Bisher fÃ¼hlte sich die Tagesschau darÃ¼ber erhaben. Sie hÃ¤tschelt lieber den freidrehenden AuÃŸenminister Maas, verharmlost beflissen die BaerbÃ¶cke der Woche und gibt Mutti Merkel als friedliebende Lichtgestalt aus, Kramp hin, Karrenbauer her. So lenkt sie das zahlende Publikum davon ab, dass wir nur um Haaresbreite um einen weiteren echten Krieg herumgekommen sind.

Left or Right â€“ Lexit or Rexit â€“ itâ€™s over. Itâ€™s time to make peace with that idea.

Penned in by the absurd Benn Act, No Deal is off the table, which means Britain will be forced to either remain or accept a deal thatâ€™s Remain by another name.

The Letwin Ammendment and Johnsonâ€™s unsigned extension request are just morbid theatre. Unneccasary nails in a well-sealed coffin.

Itâ€™s all very Weekend at Berniesâ€™ â€“ A lame cast of characters, puppeteering Brexitâ€™s corpse to keep up a tired joke that was never funny to begin with.

Parliament has become an absurd pantomime, where a clown Prime Minister â€“ his majority willfully destroyed â€“ sets up straw men that the â€œoppositionâ€ bayonet with increasingly maniacal glee. No thought is given to policy or consequences, only increasing the tally of Boris Johnsonâ€™s parliamentary defeats.

Labour, and the bedraggled, hysterical remainers in the Lib Dems/TIG/Green Party, have become nothing but contrarians â€“ automatically gain-saying anything tabled by the government for the simple joy of humiliating the nationâ€™s Court Jester in Chief.

Corbyn has been so successfully gaslighted by his remain-heavy PLP he doesnâ€™t even realise heâ€™s betraying his life-long principles, his mentor Tony Benn, and entire swaths of the Labourâ€™s Northern heartlands, who all voted to leave.

When a general election does come, it will mean nothing.

Labour will likely be destroyed as working-class voters either flock to the Brexit Party or simply collapse into the apathy of the voiceless, and stay home.

If Labour scrapes together enough voters from Remain country in Scotland and London to claw their way to a small majority, well their socialist manifesto will be crippled by the EUâ€™s austerity policy and restrictions on nationalisation.

In either event, Corbyn will be replaced by a New Labour non-entity of little renown and less worth. The papers will declare socialism dead (again), and maybe clap Corbyn on the shoulder for doing â€œwell, consideringâ€ and â€œchanging the conversationâ€.

Weâ€™ll be invited to celebrate the new (inevitably) female leader as a sign of â€œprogressâ€, while society continues to slip backwards.

Whether the hardcore Remainers get their â€œPeopleâ€™s Voteâ€ or not, and whichever of the carousel of undesirables happens to be Prime Minister when it all eventually wraps up, Brexit is dead. Parliament killed it.

This on-going, slow-burn sabotage is hard to watch â€“ but itâ€™s not what this article is about.

What itâ€™s about is a question. An important question. One that should weigh heavily on the shoulders of Remainers on the eve of their â€“ for want of a better word â€“ victory:

Do we really want this? Does the EU, right now, really look like something we want to be a part of?

Letâ€™s run down the situation on The Continent.

France is miserable, sick of austerity. Sick of spending cuts and falling standards and neo-liberal economics promising a trickle-down that never seems to come.

In Paris â€“ and many other French cities â€“ the Yellow Vests are nearing their fiftieth straight week of protests, and donâ€™t seem to be slowing down (Hopefully they plan something nice for their first birthday).

People have lost eyes, hands, even lives. The Hong Kong protests â€“ so long front-page news in the UK â€“ have been a picnic in comparison.

In Hungary, an elected President is held hostage by the bureaucracy of the EU. Whatever you think of Orban, he was democratically elected to enact the political promises he made during his campaign. That Brussels can sanction him, and threaten to remove Hungaryâ€™s voting rights, is perverse. Anti-democracy in the name of democracy.

They say itâ€™s about â€œprotecting European valuesâ€, but is it?

Thatâ€™s pretty hard to believe, considering the situation elsewhere in Europeâ€¦

Spain will join France in the flames soon. They already sent thirteen politicians to prison for sedition.

Take a moment to consider that â€“ actual â€œseditionâ€.

This comes after sending in riot police to break up a peaceful referendum. Spanish police beat voters, arrested protesters and destroyed ballot boxes.

Madrid has faced no punishment, or even criticism, for this. They â€“ unlike Orban â€“ have escaped any sanction or censure. Police attack Catalonian independence protests on the streets of Barcelonaâ€¦and Brusselsâ€™ silence is deafening.

(Imagine Russia had just jailed 13 opposition politicians for sedition. Imagine Maduro was blinding protestors with rubber bullets. The difference in coverage and attitude would be breathtaking.)

What is the difference between Budapest and Paris? Or Moscow and Madrid?

Well, Orban is anti-EU (as are the Gilets Jaunes). The governments of France and Spain are Pro EU, with a ferocity that fully justifies the capital P.

Follow a pro-EU agenda of austerity, uncontrolled immigration and globalisation and you can blind as many protesters as you want.

The harder you look, the more it seems â€œEuropean valuesâ€ is slang for â€œEuropean powerâ€.

The talk of the EU Army bubbles away on the back-burner, whilst the European Parliament merrily votes through massive funding for â€œStratComâ€ programmes to â€œcounter misinformationâ€.

We hear about peace, but we donâ€™t see it. We hear about prosperity, but we donâ€™t feel it.

Austerity is choking the birthplace of democracy to death, and its â€“ again, for want of a better word â€“ â€œleadersâ€ are spending tax revenues on propaganda and the military.

Is that going to help a single ordinary citizen out of poverty? Are these moves designed to make life fair, equal or easy for ordinary citizens? Or consolidate and enforce authority?

Look at Europe. Really look at it. Itâ€™s burning. And yet Remainers sit amongst the flames and say everythingâ€™s fine.

We are lectured on â€œEuropean Valuesâ€, but that phrase has been meaningless for years, and every day edges closer and closer to full-on parody.

Europe is a sinking ship the rats in Parliament refuse to leave.",10/20/2019 0:00,en,Real

Vaikka turvallisuuspoliittinen keskustelu on viime viikkoina yksipuolistunut, perussuomalaisilla jÃ¤senillÃ¤ on mielipiteenvapaus, ja olen itse pitÃ¤nyt tÃ¤rkeÃ¤nÃ¤, ettÃ¤ myÃ¶s Nato-keskustelussa kunnioitamme erimielisiÃ¤ asiallisia argumentteja.

EduskuntaryhmÃ¤ on lÃ¤hipÃ¤ivinÃ¤ valmistautumassa tekemÃ¤Ã¤n pÃ¤Ã¤tÃ¶ksensÃ¤, joka raamittaa edustajiemme tyÃ¶tÃ¤ valiokunnissa ja koordinaatioryhmÃ¤ssÃ¤, ja tÃ¤tÃ¤ seuraavat puoluehallitus ja puoluevaltuusto ja myÃ¶hemmin kevÃ¤Ã¤llÃ¤ puolueneuvosto. EnemmistÃ¶ kansanedustajistamme on kertonut kantansa, ja keskustelu kÃ¤y vilkkaana sekÃ¤ julkisesti ettÃ¤ puolueen sisÃ¤isillÃ¤ areenoilla. MyÃ¶s puolueen toteuttaman jÃ¤senkyselyn tulokset olivat selviÃ¤. Koen mahdolliseksi kertoa oman henkilÃ¶kohtaisen kantani Nato-jÃ¤senyyteen.

Kuten olen vuosien varrella erilaisiin vaalikoneisiin kirjannut, olisin mieluiten nÃ¤hnyt Suomen pÃ¤Ã¤tyvÃ¤n Naton jÃ¤seneksi jo 1990-luvulla VenÃ¤jÃ¤n heikkouden aikoina. Kun tÃ¤mÃ¤ ei toteutunut, ja VenÃ¤jÃ¤n aggressiot ja imperialistiset intohimot kasvoivat, jÃ¤senyyden tavoittelu tuntui yhÃ¤ ongelmallisemmalta eikÃ¤ koskaan ollut oikea hetki jÃ¤senyyden hakemiselle. Suomen omalaatuinen ja tasapainoileva suhde VenÃ¤jÃ¤Ã¤n ja turvallisuuspolitiikan Nato-optio nÃ¤yttivÃ¤t olevan riittÃ¤viÃ¤ turvallisuutemme ja koskemattomuutemme takaajia. Ja olivathan ne â€“ Suomi on saanut elÃ¤Ã¤ vuosikymmenet rauhassa ja vakaudessa. VÃ¤lillÃ¤ kiivainta Nato-huutelua seuratessani minusta nÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤ siltÃ¤, ettÃ¤ monet ovat unohtaneet sen.

Helmikuussa mureni kuitenkin paitsi eurooppalainen turvallisuusjÃ¤rjestys myÃ¶s Suomen ja VenÃ¤jÃ¤n vÃ¤lisen suhteen koko perusta. MeillÃ¤ ei ole enÃ¤Ã¤ pohjaa, jolla tasapainoilla epÃ¤mÃ¤Ã¤rÃ¤isessÃ¤ Nato-option ja kahdenvÃ¤listen suhteiden mÃ¤Ã¤rittÃ¤mÃ¤ssÃ¤ tilassa. VenÃ¤jÃ¤n raakalaismainen hyÃ¶kkÃ¤ys eurooppalaisen suvereenin valtion kimppuun hajotti vanhaan nojaavan tulevaisuutemme rakennusaineet. Vaikka tiesin sen olevan mahdollista, en kuitenkaan voinut uskoa VenÃ¤jÃ¤n toimivan tÃ¤llÃ¤ tavalla. Kyse on Ukrainasta, mutta jokainen tietÃ¤Ã¤, ettÃ¤ kyse voisi olla myÃ¶s Suomesta. Olin pakotettu tarkastelemaan kantaani jÃ¤lleen uudelleen.

Kannatan Suomen Nato-jÃ¤senyyttÃ¤ ja tuen valtiojohtoa jÃ¤senyyden edistÃ¤misessÃ¤. En nÃ¤e Nato-jÃ¤senyyttÃ¤ ongelmiemme automaattisena poispyyhkijÃ¤nÃ¤ vaan tavoiteltavana osana Suomen turvallisuus- ja puolustuspoliittista palettia. Parhaiten Suomen turvallisuutta ja itsenÃ¤isyyttÃ¤ tukee oman vahvan ja entisestÃ¤Ã¤n vahvistettavan puolustuskyvyn ja puolustushalun perustan lisÃ¤ksi jÃ¤senyys Natossa. Puolustuksemme perusta on aina omissa kÃ¤sissÃ¤mme. Puolustusliiton hyÃ¶dyt nÃ¤en erityisesti ennaltaehkÃ¤isyn ja pelotteen kannalta. Samaan aikaan suvereniteettiamme ja turvallisuuttamme tulee vahvistaa myÃ¶s muulla tavoin, esimerkiksi rajaturvallisuuteen, hybridiuhkien torjuntaan ja ruoka- ja energiahuoltoon tehtÃ¤vin toimenpitein. Maahan voidaan hyÃ¶kÃ¤tÃ¤ myÃ¶s ilman aseita.

Natossa on ehkÃ¤ huojentavaa olla, mutta ensin sinne pitÃ¤isi pÃ¤Ã¤stÃ¤. Tunnistan prosessin uhkakuvat, VenÃ¤jÃ¤n poliittisesta painostuksesta vakavampiin toimiin asti, mutta en nÃ¤e, ettÃ¤ niitÃ¤ voitaisiin vÃ¤lttÃ¤Ã¤ myÃ¶skÃ¤Ã¤n olemalla hakematta. MikÃ¤li eduskunta pÃ¤Ã¤ttÃ¤Ã¤ hakea Nato-jÃ¤senyyttÃ¤, kuten toivon, valtiojohdolta vaaditaan hakemuksen riittÃ¤vÃ¤n suotuisan vastaanoton varmistamista kaikista jÃ¤senmaista. Samoin valtiojohdon tulee varmistaa hakemuksen jÃ¤ttÃ¶ajan ja jÃ¤senyyden saavuttamisen vÃ¤liselle ajalle sopiva turva eli kÃ¤ytÃ¤nnÃ¶ssÃ¤ riittÃ¤vÃ¤t puolustusyhteistyÃ¶n takuut tÃ¤rkeimpien Nato-maiden kanssa.

Rick Rozoff

The stark threat in the headline was made by Leonid Kravchuk, head of the Ukrainian delegation to the Trilateral Contact Group on the Donbass conflict, currently suspended because of Ukraineâ€™s objection to the site of the talks to date, the Belarusian capital of Minsk. The host country is neither a member nor an advanced partner of NATO and as such is viewed by Kiev as being too closely allied with Russia â€“ itself a member of the group with Ukraine and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

Kravchukâ€™s exact words will be cited in a moment, but first itâ€™s important to establish who it is that made them; that the comments all but threatening a third world war, in the modern era inevitably a nuclear one, were not off-the-cuff casual remarks by a minor bureaucrat, but were those of a person who can fairly be described as the founder of the Ukrainian nation.

In 1991 Kravchuk, Boris Yeltsin and Stanislav Shushkevich â€“ the presidents of the Ukrainian and Russian Soviet Socialist Republics and the parliament chairman of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, respectively â€“ and their three republicsâ€™ prime ministers signed the Belavezha Accords dissolving the Soviet Union. In the same month, December, Kravchuk became the first president of an independent Ukraine. He held that post until 1994, the year Ukraine became the first member of NATOâ€™s first military partnership program, the Partnership for Peace, which has been used to prepare the sixteen new members inducted into the military bloc since 1999; all in Eastern Europe, four of them bordering Russia.

Today he was quoted by the Ukrainian news agency UNIAN asserting that Ukraineâ€™s â€œinternational partners,â€ for which read NATO members and partners, have assured his nation that â€œUkraine will not be left alone facing Russian aggression,â€ and that Europe and the U.S. would assist it should such aggression occur or continue.

Indeed by way of confirmation of Kravchukâ€™s contention, yesterday NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said after an emergency meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba at the allianceâ€™s headquarters:

â€œWe are seriously concerned by ongoing developments. And NATO is monitoring the situation very closely. In recent weeks, Russia has moved thousands of combat-ready troops to Ukraineâ€™s borders. The largest massing of Russian troops since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.â€

Unscheduled visits by the foreign ministers of the four NATO nations near Ukraine â€“ Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland â€“ have recently occurred or will tomorrow.

Against that backdrop the former Ukrainian head of state said the following, which requires no comment:

â€œA citizen, a patriot, and a warrior are all part of one. And today I see how peopleâ€™s awareness is rising in many regions, where people are starting to say that we need to be ready for anything. By saying so, I want to convey to Russia so that they realize, so that the Kremlin realizes, that it will be no parade. If they dare, if they turn insane and go to war against Ukraine, this will mark the start of a large-scale conflict that could escalate into World War 3. It will be no easy movement, as they experienced in Crimea.â€

Itâ€™s to be feared that for all the bravado contained in the above statement â€“ whether intended as warning or as threat â€“ it may not be such an implausible scenario.",4/14/2021 0:00,en,Real

The Diia mobile app â€” and its accompanying online e-services portal â€” allows citizens to digitize their national ID and biometric passport, personal tax number, student ID, and more, and the digital documents wield the same legal power as the original paper ones. Within a year, Ukraine became the fourth European country to have a digital driverâ€™s license and the first country in the world to have a digital passport.

However, a massive data leak last year has raised concerns about the level of protection around usersâ€™ personal information. In May 2020, activists discovered about 900 GB of citizensâ€™ personal data being traded by an anonymous chatbot on the popular messaging platform Telegram. The dataset included passport numbers, personal tax numbers, residence information, driverâ€™s licenses, social media passwords, and even bank details of millions of Ukrainians.

Some public officials accused Diia of leaking data from government registries, while security experts recalled that the Ministry of Digital Transformation had yet to release any security documentation for the app. While journalists and researchers were able to confirm that part of the datasets had come from Ukrainian government registries, no evidence implicating Diia directly has been found.

On the anniversary of its launch, Diia app boasts over 6 million users. At the same time, IT specialists and digital rights defenders continue to call on the government to consider all of the risks that e-government and digital identification technology carry, as these may potentially undermine the public's trust.

Digitizing the nation

While the idea of digitizing public services is not new to Ukraine, Zelensky's is the first administration that has made e-governance a top priority or established a separate ministry entirely dedicated to it â€” the Ministry of Digital Transformation, headed by Mykhailo Fedorov.

Originally presented in the spring of 2019, the ambitious â€œState in a Smartphoneâ€ program envisioned moving all public services online and providing the majority of the citizens with a means of digital identification. It was later expanded to include goals such as increasing people's digital literacy, expanding internet infrastructure, and creating favorable conditions for the development of the information technology (IT) industry.

If implemented successfully, the program could help combat corruption by minimizing the interference and arbitrary decisions of public officials, while significantly reducing state bureaucracy.

In addition, Minister Fedorov has proudly noted that not a single hryvnya from the state budget had been spent on the development of the Diia app â€” its development team comprised 35 volunteers from the well-known software engineering company EPAM Systems. They later transferred the completed product and relevant technical know-how to the state.

How secure are citizensâ€™ data in Ukraine?

Initially, the ministry announced that Diia used BankID technology from several leading Ukrainian banks for user authorization, and that it utilized a secure cloud server for the transfer of encrypted data.

Still, few disclosures were made about the security of citizensâ€™ personal data on the app, and security specialists cautiously noted that not enough was known about Diia's security testing.

No independent security audit seemed to have been performed, for example â€” hardly acceptable for technology to which millions of citizens would be entrusting their personal information. In fact, the app's first public bug bounty program was not launched until December 2020.

The leaks have made clear that the standard of data security at the state level in Ukraine remains inadequate â€” including a weak legal data protection regime, poor enforcement, and the lack of appropriate protection measures within state institutions themselves. Synchronization of data from various government registries into one portal or app is therefore likely to result in additional vulnerabilities to external attacks.

Moreover, in December 2019, the government granted the Ministry of Internal Affairs the power to verify and aggregate citizensâ€™ data from multiple state registries, providing the law enforcement body with access to data from at least five government registries, including those that handle civil, tax, social security, healthcare and voter information. Alarmingly, the data sharing was to be carried out as a part of an â€œexperimentalâ€ process that lacked comprehensive legal safeguards ensuring citizensâ€™ right to privacy.

According to an analysis by digital rights advocates from Digital Security Lab, as of August 2020, the interior ministry had not yet developed a methodology for such verification, but this has not prevented it from gaining access to the vast trove of citizensâ€™ personal data.

Vita Volodovska, a lawyer with Digital Security Lab, concluded:

Whereas in the case of digital display of documents in smartphones, â€˜experimentalâ€™ access to information is carried out with the consent of users, albeit without full compliance with the principle of legal certainty, the transfer of personal data from state registries to the interior ministry in another experiment, with neither the consent of citizens nor any independent control, contradicts the requirements of current legislation and the Constitution of Ukraine.

The fast-moving scandal involving President Donald Trump and allegations that he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, has upended politics in Washington, DC, and evolved into a full-blown impeachment investigation. There is no evidence that either Biden did anything wrong.

For an up-to-the-minute look at who has testified and who has not, go to the impeachment tracker. To meet the players, read on.

The whistleblower

An anonymous government worker - with access to White House officials - who filed an official complaint against the President claiming that multiple officials had concerns that Trump was using his public office to seek personal political gain from a foreign power not just through his July 25 phone conversation with Zelensky but through emissaries including Trumpâ€™s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as well as, possibly, Attorney General Bill Barr. The complaint also alleges a coverup by White House staffers who sought to bury Trumpâ€™s conversation with the Ukrainian President by placing a rough transcript of it in a computer system reserved for highly classified material.

Just as he was trying to move on from allegations his campaign colluded with Russians against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Trump was ramping up efforts to get Ukraine to stir up trouble for his prospective 2020 challenger Biden. He used official channels to ask the Ukrainian President to look into the Biden family, openly asking Zelensky for a favor during a phone call on July 25 and then suggested his attorney meet with Ukrainian officials. In the July 25 phone call, the Ukrainian President mentioned plans to buy US-made Javelin missiles â€“ which he needs to help guard against potential Russian provocations. At the very same time, Trump was sitting on nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine, which he has argued was on hold while he leaned on European countries to give more to Ukraine.

Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine

A comedian turned politician, Zelenskyâ€™s job before being elected the President of Ukraine was playing the President of Ukraine on television. His country is in the midst of a years-long standoff with Russia over Crimea, an area Russia invaded and annexed in 2014. Zelensky is also dealing with a war against pro-Russian separatists. But his intentions â€“ and whether he is pro-Russian or pro-West â€“ have been something both sides have been trying to determine. His desire for military aid from the US is unquestioned. He flattered Trump during their phone call in July and promised a fair look at the Biden family after Trump asked for an investigation. But Zelensky clearly does not want to get involved in US politics, and said after the White House released its transcript of the July 25 call that he didnâ€™t think his side would be included.

Rudy Giuliani, Trump attorney

The former New York mayor, now the Presidentâ€™s personal attorney and staunch defender on cable news, is at the center of the Ukraine scandal. He has said he went to Ukraine because was trying to undermine the beginnings of the Russia investigation and protect Trumpâ€™s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is currently in prison for tax fraud linked to his business dealings in Ukraine. Giuliani has said he then pivoted after learning about claims concerning Joe Bidenâ€™s actions as Vice President, including his public calls in 2016 for a prosecutor in Ukraine to be fired. Giuliani claims that was improper because, at the time, Bidenâ€™s son sat on the board of a Ukrainian company that had once been under investigation in Ukraine. After pushing the story about Biden for months, Giuliani ultimately met with a top aide to Zelensky in Madrid, days after the July 25 phone call where Trump asked Zelensky to hear Giuliani out.

William Barr, US attorney general

Barr took over as head of the Department of Justice in February 2019, and oversaw the official release of the Mueller report summing up the governmentâ€™s investigation into claims that Russia engaged with the Trump campaign to tamper with the 2016 election. Trump asked the Ukrainian President to talk with Barr as part of an investigation he said Barr was conducting. Barr has remained quiet about any involvement in Ukraine, but Democrats have said they expect him to be called to testify.

Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of state

The former Kansas congressman and CIA chief has emerged as one of Trumpâ€™s most trusted advisers. While Pompeo is not mentioned by name in the whistleblower complaint, Giuliani has said the State Department helped set up his meetings with Zelensky aides. Pompeo was subpoenaed by House committees as part of the impeachment inquiry on September 27.

Mike Pence, vice president of the US

When Trump canceled a September trip to Poland during which he was supposed to meet with Zelensky, Pence went instead. The vice president told reporters after the meeting that he did not discuss Biden, but that he talked to Zelensky in great detail about Trumpâ€™s interest in rooting out corruption in Ukraine, and also about US aid to Ukraine.

Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence

A retired vice admiral and former Navy SEAL, Maguire stepped into his role when former DNI Dan Coats resigned in August. Maguire initially withheld the whistleblower complaint from Congress because his attorneys counseled him that Trump was not part of the intelligence community. Weeks into the job, heâ€™s already been called to testify before Congress over the Ukraine scandal. In that congressional testimony he defended the whistleblower for coming forward.

Alongside the allegations about Trumpâ€™s effort to influence the Ukrainian President against Biden are the whistleblowerâ€™s allegation that White House lawyers sought to cover things up by burying the transcript of the call in a server reserved for highly classified information. Cipollone, as White House counsel, was also involved in the recommendation that Maguire should withhold the whistleblower complaint from Congress, according to the Washington Post.

A former federal prosecutor, Schiff is a confidant of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She has designated the California congressman to take the lead in the Democratsâ€™ inquiry into the whistleblower complaint. He is a frequent target of Trump, who refers to him as â€œliddleâ€ Adam Schiff.

Pelosi is in her second stint as the top elected Democrat in the country, and nothing will move forward on impeachment without her support. After months of slowing calls by Democrats for impeachment proceedings over the findings of the Mueller report, Pelosi quickly moved to change course and begin official impeachment proceedings after the substance of Trumpâ€™s Ukraine actions as detailed in the whistleblower complaint became clear.

If Schiff is the prosecutor, Nunes â€“ also from California â€“ will play the role of Trumpâ€™s defender. Long an apologist for the President on the Russia investigation, Nunes has pivoted to defending Trump on Ukraine. With his seat next to Schiff, he will play an important role.

A holdover from the administration that preceded Zelensky in Ukraine, Lutsenko was Giulianiâ€™s original target to influence toward an investigation of the Bidens and Burisma. Lutsenko said in May he had looked to reanimate the investigation, but also that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. His comments to a reporter for The Hill that there should be an investigation into whether Ukrainians had meddled in the 2016 US election may have helped fuel Giulianiâ€™s focus on Ukraine. He resigned in August.

Shokin was named Ukraineâ€™s top prosecutor under former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko in 2015 and began facing criticism for what was seen as an unwillingness to prosecute elite corruption. Biden, who handled Ukraine issues for the Obama administration, put public and private pressure on the Ukraine government to fire Shokin. The Obama administration threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Poroshenko took action. Trump has seized on this to accuse Biden of wrongdoing â€“ despite no evidence of this â€“ and the international calls for Shokinâ€™s firing at the time. The Ukraine legislature voted to oust Shokin in March 2016. Bidenâ€™s last visit to Ukraine before Shokinâ€™s firing was in December 2015, though he held a phone call with Poroshenko before the dismissal.

Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman

Soviet-born American associates of Giuliani who helped him in Ukraine but also had business interests there, Fruman and Parnas were arrested on campaign finance violation allegations in the US. It has since been reported by CNN that federal authorities are scrutinizing their business ties to Giuliani. Their alleged campaign finance misdeeds include making campaign contributions using so-called â€œstraw donors.â€ They donated $325,000 to a Trump-aligned super PAC in 2018 and have put pictures of themselves with the President on social media. The super PAC, America First ACTION, said in a statement it never spent the money.

Vladimir Putin, President of Russia

Putin is not directly related to the whistleblower complaint, but his shadow looms over this entire story and generally over Trumpâ€™s presidency. The reason Zelensky and Ukraine want the military aid is their standoff with Russia over Russiaâ€™s 2014 annexation of Crimea.

Andriy Yermak, aide to Ukrainian President

A top adviser to Zelensky, Yermak met with Giuliani in Madrid a week after Trumpâ€™s call with Zelensky. According to the whistleblower complaint, various US officials said this meeting was a â€œdirect follow-upâ€ to the July 25th call. Heâ€™s also the aide who US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland spoke with on the sidelines of a Sept. 1 meeting between Pence and Zelensky. Sondland testified that he told Yermak that US security assistance was conditional on the investigations.

T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, State Department Counselor

A West Point classmate and business partner of Pompeo, Brechbuhl is mentioned in the complaint as having listened to Trumpâ€™s call with Zelensky as it occurred. The State Department has denied he listened in.

Kurt Volker, US Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations

Formerly the administrationâ€™s point person on Ukraine, Volker is a key figure in this story. Heâ€™s mentioned in the whistleblower complaint as trying to advise Ukrainian officials on how to deal with Trump and Giuliani. It was Volker who apparently set up the meeting between Giuliani and Yermak, Zelenskyâ€™s aide. He was essentially a volunteer, however, and still works for BGR group, a Washington lobbying firm that has represented the government of Ukraine. Volker resigned his position and was the first witness called by House investigators in their impeachment probe. Text messages he gave three House committees showed concern among diplomats that the Trump administration was withholding funding over Trumpâ€™s demands for an investigation of his political rivals.

Mentioned in the complaint alongside Volker, the two were said by the whistleblower to be advising the Ukrainian leadership about how to deal with Trump and Giuliani. In text messages released by Volker, Sondland tells a US diplomat concerned the President is withholding funding in exchange for an investigation that he is mistaken about the Presidentâ€™s intentions. Sondland told Congress after his initial testimony that reports about the testimony of other witnesses jogged his memory, and he revised his own comments to make clear he did tell Yermak that aid was contingent on the political investigations. He said in public testimony that there was a quid pro quo.

William B. Taylor, chargÃ© dâ€™affaires for US Embassy in Ukraine

Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, was intimately involved in talks between Volker, Sondland and aides of Zelensky. He repeatedly raised concerns in text messages that the administration was withholding funding in exchange for an investigation of Trumpâ€™s political rivals. He was ambassador to Ukraine during the George W. Bush administration and was brought back as the top official there after the recall of Yovanovitch. In congressional testimony, he detailed for impeachment investigators how he came to feel that Trump was holding up security aid to force the Ukrainians to launch investigations into the beginnings of the Mueller probe and also Burisma.

After complaints by Lutsenko, the Ukrainian prosecutor, and Republicans in the US, Yovanovitch was recalled from her post. A career member of the foreign service who has served in ambassadorships under three presidents, she was sworn in as ambassador to Ukraine in August 2016 and recalled in May 2019, prompting Democrats to accuse the White House of a â€œpolitical hit job.â€ In the phone call with Zelensky, Trump disparaged her, calling her â€œbad newsâ€ and saying, â€œsheâ€™s going to go through some things.â€ In damning testimony on Capitol Hill, Yovanovitch said it was her understanding she was targeted by Giuliani and she issued a dire warning about diplomacy during the Trump administration.

A career foreign service officer, Kent is now the top policy official for Eurasia, including Ukraine. He was number two in the US embassy to Ukraine from 2015 to 2018, so his experience there spans time under Trump, as well as when then-Vice President Joe Biden was pressuring Ukraine to do more to combat corruption. He told impeachment investigators that Trump associates made baseless claims against Yovanovitch. He also said he raised some concerns in 2015 about Hunter Bidenâ€™s position on the Burisma board.

Fiona Hill, former top White House Russia adviser

A notable critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hill officially resigned from her position with the National Security Council as Trumpâ€™s top Russia policy adviser in August. She is mentioned in text messages given to House Democrats as part of the impeachment inquiry by former US Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker. She told investigators that former National Security Adviser John Bolton was suspicious of why aid was being held up and that he referred to shadow diplomacy being conducted in Ukraine as a kind of â€œdrug deal.â€ In congressional testimony she deconstructed the idea that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election as Trump and other Republicans have alleged.

Tim Morrison, Russia expert on National Security Counsel

Morrison succeeded Hill at the NSC, but is already planning to leave. Heâ€™s mentioned in text messages as a key contact at the White House for Sondland, Volker and Taylor. But he told impeachment investigators he tried to figure out whether Trump told Sondland he wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Heâ€™s among a number of officials who worried Giuliani and others were pushing a shadow foreign policy.

Lt. Colonel Alexander Vindman, Ukraine expert on National Security Counsel

Alex Wong/Getty Images

Vindman was on the call between Trump and Zelensky and he told impeachment investigators he raised concerns afterward with the top lawyer on the NSC. He also testified the official transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call omitted some key words. Vindman was born in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union and fled to the US as a child, which led Trump and some Republicans to question his patriotism, despite his war service.

A longtime State Department staffer, Williams is detailed to Penceâ€™s office as special adviser on European and Russian affairs and was one of two Pence aides on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The other was Keith Kellogg, the vice presidentâ€™s national security adviser. She was concerned about the call but did not inform her superiors about it.

David Hale, under secretary of state for political affairs

A career foreign service officer, Reeker testified that he didnâ€™t know about the push for Ukraine to undertake investigations.

Michael McKinley, former State Department senior adviser

Andrew Harnik/AP

A former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, McKinley told lawmakers he quit his post because he didnâ€™t feel the department was sticking up for Yovanovitch. He said he was also concerned US political objectives were being thrust on diplomats.

John Eisenberg, a deputy White House counsel

The first person at the White House notified about concerns ultimately raised by the whistleblower. He and the intelligence agencyâ€™s general counsel contacted the Justice Department together, according to The New York Times. Heâ€™s the top lawyer on the National Security Counsel, the person to whom Vindman raised concerns about the call between Trump and Zelensky and also the person who directed the call transcript be placed in a more secure server.

John Bolton, former National Security Adviser

Bolton left the White House in a huff in September. Hill testified he was leery of Giulianiâ€™s efforts and also of the holdup in aid to Ukraine. She said he referred to Giuliani as a â€œhand grenadeâ€ and the shadow diplomacy operation as a â€œdrug deal.â€

Charles Kupperman, former deputy national security adviser

A former aide who shares an attorney with former National Security Advisor John Bolton, Kupperman was on the call between Trump and Zelensky. But heâ€™s since left the White House. He asked the courts to weigh in on whether he should respect a congressional subpoena or a White House claim that his testimony is privileged even though heâ€™s no longer at the White House.

Mick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff

A key figure at the White House, Mulvaney was integral in holding up funding to Ukraine. He argued to reporters that, yes, essentially, there was a quid pro quo, but thatâ€™s totally okay in politics and diplomacy. He later clarified the comments. Along with most White House officials, he has refused to testify on Capitol Hill.

Perry has announced his intention to resign, but he plays an important role in the Ukraine investigation. He traveled to Ukraine to meet the new president and he was deeply involved in US policy there, along with Volker and Sondland. For Perry, this also included efforts to push Ukraine to change leadership at Naftogaz, Ukraineâ€™s geopolitically important state-owned oil and gas company. That goal was shared by Giulianiâ€™s clients Parnas and Fruman.

As ICIG, Atkinson was the first to receive the whistleblower complaint. He informed Congress that it was initially being withheld from the House Intelligence committee despite his determination that it represented an â€œurgent concern.â€ He told the committee he was at an â€œimpasseâ€ with Maguire over the complaint and whether Congress should be informed about its existence or its contents. He was appointed to his position by Trump after many years at the Department of Justice.

Stephen Engel, Director, Office of Legal Counsel

A top attorney at the Department of Justice, it was Engelâ€™s job to review whether the whistleblower complaint was an â€œurgent concernâ€ from the perspective of the DOJ. He recommended keeping the complaint at the DOJ for a possible criminal probe instead of sending to Congress, as the law would seem to require. That set up the showdown between Atkinson, the inspector general and Maguire, the acting DNI.

General counsel at an intelligence agency

Even before the whistleblower filed the complaint, the White House was aware of the whistleblowerâ€™s concerns because an intelligence agencyâ€™s general counsel notified lawyers at the Justice Department and the White House after the whistleblower flagged them through an anonymous process, according to The New York Times.

John Demers, head of the Justice Departmentâ€™s national security division; Jeffrey Rosen, deputy attorney general; Brian Benczkowski, head of DOJ criminal division

Demers was the first attorney at the DOJ notified of concerns about Trumpâ€™s conduct raised by the whistleblower and discussed it with colleagues Rosen and Benczkowski at Department of Justice, according to The New York Times. Itâ€™s not clear when or how Barr was notified.

Andrew Bakaj and Mark Zaid, attorneys for the whistleblower

Bakaj worked in the CIA inspector generalâ€™s office before being forced out in 2014. A subsequent report by the Department of Homeland Security inspector general cleared him of any wrongdoing, according to Yahoo News. Now in private practice, Bakaj and Zaid, who work together on whistleblower and security clearance cases, are representing the whistleblower.

Limited access to medical care increases the need to look for alternative sources of medical information. Aim: To analyze trends of Internet usersâ€™ interest in sexual and reproductive health in Ukraine based on Google Trends. Materials and Methods: The retrospective study was based on the analysis of terms related to sexual and reproductive health searched by Ukrainian Internet users. The tool used was Google Trends. The period from 1 January 2021 to 1 January 2023 was analyzed. The time variability in search growths and peaks was assessed from the perspective of two time intervals (before the war and during the war) using the chi-square test. Results: Significant changes have been demonstrated in the interests of Internet users from Ukraine regarding selected issues of sexual and reproductive health during the ongoing war. Compared to the pre-war period, a marked increase was observed in active searches for terms such as â€œcondomsâ€ (p = 0.0081), â€œrapeâ€ (p = 0.0008), â€œsyphilisâ€ (p = 0.0136), â€œovulationâ€ (p = 0.0002) and â€œpregnancy testâ€ (p = 0.0008). Conclusions: The conducted analysis clearly indicates an increased need for information regarding sexual and reproductive health among Ukrainian citizens during the ongoing armed conflict. The analysis of trends among Internet users interests can be a valuable source of knowledge for decision makers, including human rights organizations, regarding the scope and coordination of activities aimed at protecting the sexual and reproductive health of the inhabitants of Ukraine.

The subsequent parts of the paper include the purpose of the work, the methodology of the research conducted and a list of the keywords analyzed. The results of the analysis of 22 keywords, including the peaks of interest in them both before and after 24 February 2022, were analyzed. The relevance of the results is compared with the literature in the discussion section, making arguments for the conclusions section.

According to the international ranking conducted in February 2022, the most popular Internet search engine in the world is Google (Googleâ€”73.95%, Bingâ€”15.81%, Baiduâ€”3.88%) [ 8 ]. An interesting Google service is the free tool Google Trends (GT), a service that provides daily insight into what the world is searching for on Google, showing the relative amount of search traffic for any query in any language depending on the time and region of queries directed to Google Search. The analysis of web search trends can be useful for advertisers, economists, scientists and all other people interested in knowing what Internet users are interested in [ 9 , 10 , 11 ].

Sexuality as well as contraception are no longer taboo topics; the key role in this matter is played by open access to information via the Internet, which is a popular source of knowledge about health. In the opinion of users, the Internet gives a great sense of freedom in searching for information [ 4 ]. Nearly three-quarters of Internet users look for health information on the Internet [ 5 ]. The role of the Internet during armed conflict can be of particular importance as it is frequently the only available source of information. For numerous Internet users, it is the first-choice source of information before seeking advice from a medical specialist [ 6 ]. A Research & Branding Group survey from February 2021 demonstrated that the Internet was, for the first time, the main source of information (51% preferred the Internet and 41% television) for Ukrainians [ 7 ].

Reproductive health is a component of sexual health. According to the WHO, it is a set of biological, emotional, intellectual and social aspects of sexual life, necessary for the positive development of human personality, communication and love. The definition given clearly classifies that sexuality should be based on respect, safety and freedom from discrimination [ 1 ]. Armed conflicts prevent the full realization of all the assumptions that are assigned to the defined terms. The war in Ukraine has resulted in a crisis in access to safe childbirth and neonatal care, contraceptives to prevent unwanted pregnancy, safe abortion, comprehensive sex education for youth, prevention and treatment of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, and protection of people of different sexual orientations and gender identity [ 2 ]. The global organization Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research emphasizes that attention should be paid to the impacts of conflicts and forced migration on the sexual and reproductive health of Ukrainian citizens [ 3 ].

The study was conducted between 2 and 5 January 2023. The period from 1 January 2021 to 1 January 2023 was analyzed. According to the Google Trends algorithm, search interest was quantified on a normalized scale of 0â€“100 GT, with the highest indicator assigned to 100. The study included, in detail, the growths and peaks of searches on a scale of 0â€“100 GT. Keywords for which the number of searches did not reach the minimum value threshold in the analyzed time were excluded. The time variability in the search was assessed from the perspective of two time intervals, i.e., before 24 February 2022, prior to the outbreak of the war, and after 24 February 2022, during the war. We used the goodness-of-fit chi-square test and checked whether the observed proportions differed from the expected values, assuming an even distribution of results (50% each before and after the war). This is otherwise known as the chi-2 concordance test. It was assessed whether the numbers in terms of interest in given terms were significantly different in these time intervals. The chi-square test was used assuming a significance level of p < 0.05.

The analyzed keywords were selected in a multi-stage process. Initially, keywords were chosen by brainstorming possible words that we thought were common in the fields. In addition, we checked what other GT researchers had analyzed on related topics to find out about any important topics or keywords that we might have missed. While performing the analysis in GT, we also paid attention to similar topics displayed in GT, which were a hint of what other terms were being searched by other users searching for terms similar to ours. Keywords for which the number of searches did not reach the minimum value threshold in the analyzed time were excluded. Table 1 is presented below.

In this retrospective study, a selection of sexual and reproductive health keywords searched on the Internet were analyzed. The tool used was Google Trends, with the help of which we obtained data on the number, origin, dependence on time and main regions of queries directed to the Google search engine. The ranking of the obtained entries was sorted by language (all entries were entered in Ukrainian); the entries were also sorted by country (the territorial scope was selectedâ€”Ukraine).

The greatest interest in the term â€œintrauterine deviceâ€ in the analyzed time period was recorded on 2â€“8 January 2022 (100 on the GT scale)â€” Figure 1 . The analysis showed a significant decrease in interest in the term â€œintrauterine deviceâ€ during the war compared to the time before the conflict (p < 0.0001). The lowest interest in the analyzed time period was recorded from 5 March 2022 to 30 July 2022 and from 17 September 2022 to 19 November 2022 (0 on the GT scale)â€” Table 2 .

The greatest interest in the keyword â€œcontraceptionâ€ was recorded on 25â€“31 August 2021 and 16â€“22 October 2022 (100 on the GT scale)â€” Figure 1 . The greatest interest in the term â€œemergency contraceptionâ€ was recorded on 24â€“30 July 2022 (GT 100). The peak of interest in the term â€œmorning-after pillâ€ was recorded between 28 February and 6 March 2021. The research showed no significant difference in interest in the terms â€œcontraceptionâ€ (p = 1.0000), â€œemergency contraceptionâ€ (p = 0.1349) and â€œmorning-after pillâ€ (p = 0.6658) during the war compared to the time before the conflictâ€” Table 2 .

4. Discussion

The impacts of war and related forced migration significantly affect sexual and reproductive health. During armed conflicts, the need for contraception is also an important issue, as is the availability of basic and menstrual hygiene products [2]. Access to intimate hygiene products can become particularly difficult as products become difficult to access, increasing the risks of compromised sanitary health, stigma, discomfort and safety [3,12]. In this project, no significant difference was found in the interest of Internet users from Ukraine in terms of â€œmenstruationâ€ and â€œtamponâ€ in the analyzed time periods.

Contraception is a basic element of birth control, and the choice of contraceptive method depends on many factors; the ideal contraceptive method should be effective, safe, reversible, cheap, widely available and easy to use. Various methods of contraception are available, including hormonal contraception such as birth control pills, implants under the skin, patches, intrauterine devices, injections, and vaginal rings (contraceptive rings); barrier methods such as female and male condoms, cervical caps, vaginal sponges with spermicide, and diaphragms; and surgical sterilization or natural methods with sexual abstinence during the fertile period [13]. Insufficient knowledge about the methods of conception control can lead to unwanted pregnancy. Ukraine was one of the 189 countries that signed the UN Millennium Declaration (A/RES/55/2) committing to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 [14]. In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, goal 3.7 states: â€œBy 2030, ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, information and education, and integrate reproductive health into national strategies and programsâ€. This indicator is useful for assessing the overall level of coverage of family planning programs and services. Access to and use of effective pregnancy prevention measures help women and their partners exercise their right to freely and responsibly decide the number and spacing of their children, and to have the information, education and resources to do so. This indicator is calculated using nationally representative household survey data and compiled into a global dataset on global contraceptive use. Global and regional estimates are derived from estimates and projections of family planning indicators. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 3.7.1 refers to the percentage of women of reproductive age (aged 15â€“49) who have their family planning needs met by modern methods. [15,16]. Despite the increase in the prevalence of contraception worldwide (from 54.8% in 1990 to 63.3% in 2010), there was no sharp change in the contraceptive prevalence rate in Ukraine (from 66.6% in 1990 to 67.0% in 2010) [17]. Among the long-acting reversible methods of contraception, only intrauterine contraceptives are available in Ukraine. From August 2017, implants have been unavailable in Ukraine. The cost of a copper IUD is around EUR 15â€“20 and a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD is around EUR 700. Injectable contraceptives containing medroxyprogesterone acetate cost EUR 15â€“20 per injection, while oral contraceptive pills for three monthsâ€™ use are around EUR 10â€“15. The economic crisis in Ukraine in 2014â€“2015 contributed to a sharp increase in the cost of imported drugs, which also affected hormonal contraceptives. The advertising of modern long-acting reversible methods of contraception on Ukrainian social media is not allowed; however, there are many other forums and websites where women share their experiences with using hormonal contraception [18]. It is important that progress towards meeting the demand for contraception takes into account the changing context in which it is used [19]. The conducted analysis showed no significant difference in the interest of Ukrainian Internet users in the terms â€œcontraceptionâ€ and â€œemergency contraceptionâ€ in the analyzed time periods.

Intrauterine contraception and subdermal implants are the most effective methods of contraception, especially for women who choose long-acting methods [18].

The study by Podolski et al. showed that Ukrainian women prefer natural methods of contraception, condoms and oral contraception [18]. The use of barrier contraception in the form of condoms among married women aged 15â€“49 in Ukraine has increased in recent years [20]. This is confirmed by the results of research conducted in a group of 500 women from Ukraine who had an abortion or childbirth (250 women after abortion and 250 women after childbirth). These studies have shown that there is little knowledge about contraception such as intrauterine devices and implants. Barrier methods and oral contraceptives were the most commonly used methods, while only a few women used IUDs [18]. High rates of IUD use were found in a study conducted in the western region of Ukraine in 2003 [21], while reports from other regions in the same period indicate barrier methods as being the preferred method of family planning [22,23,24]. The probable reason for this difference may be the fact that the western region closely borders two European countries, allowing women access to information on modern methods of contraception [25,26]. In Ukraine, since the beginning of the war, many women have been actively involved in the defense sphere, especially in the eastern regions of the country. This requires addressing gender-related medical issues such as birth control, menstrual regulation, hygiene issues and pregnancy. Women in the active military service are characterized by a high percentage of unwanted pregnancies and low use of contraceptive methods, which may be related to the lack of awareness and limited access to contraception. Hormonal contraception may be beneficial for this group of women [27]. The analysis showed a significant increase in interest in the term â€œcondomsâ€ during the war compared to the pre-conflict period, as well as a significant decrease in interest in the term â€œintrauterine deviceâ€ during the war. However, there was no significant difference in interest in the terms â€œcontraceptive pillsâ€ and â€œmorning-after pillsâ€ in the analyzed time periods.

At the outbreak of the war (24 February 2022), there were 9.4 million women of reproductive age in Ukraine, of whom 265,000 were pregnant [12,28,29]. The population of Ukraine has been gradually decreasing since 2000; in 2020, it had 41,902.4 citizens. According to official statistics, the total fertility rate in Ukraine in 2018 was 1.301 per woman aged 15â€“49, a decrease from 1.776 in 1991, when the country gained independence [20,28]. Counselling on family planning methods in Ukraine is usually provided by obstetricians and gynecologists in family planning clinics, outpatient clinics or hospitals (maternity homes) [18]. The analysis carried out in our study showed a significant increase in interest in the terms â€œpregnancy testâ€ and â€œovulationâ€ during the war compared to the time before the war. However, there was no significant difference in the interest in the terms â€œpregnancyâ€, â€œsymptoms of pregnancyâ€, â€œbirthâ€ and â€œgynecologistâ€ in the analyzed time periods.

The incidence of STIs over 5 years in Ukraine (2014â€“2019) has changed as follows: syphilis has decreased by a factor of almost 1.5 (from 8.65 to 6.01 per 100,000), but has remained significantly high at reproductive age (13.25 vs. 9.56 per 100,000), and men are more susceptible; a significant reduction in the incidence of gonorrhea by a factor of 1.8 (from 14.85 to 7.97 per 100,000) has been observed, but among men and women of reproductive age, it has increased by factors of 2.5 and 3, respectively (37.26 and 24.12 per 100,000), and men are more susceptible [30]. Contraception is also a method of preventing sexually transmitted infections. This study showed, from the results of internet users, a significant increase in interest in the term â€œsyphilisâ€ during the war, but no significant difference in interest in the term â€œgonorrheaâ€.

At the beginning of the war, approximately 260,000 adults and children had HIV [12]. Aggression against Ukraine has had a major impact on the health and safety of people living with and infected with HIV. Those who remain in the country face the deprivation of required health services, and the availability of required services is also an issue for those seeking refuge in other countries. As noted by the International AIDS Society in its recent statement, Ukraine has the second largest HIV epidemic in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, with an estimated 250,000 people living with HIV, and one of the largest HIV responses in the region. More than 150,000 people in Ukraine are on antiretroviral therapy. Many thousands of others are at particular risk of HIV infection due to difficulties in accessing HIV prevention methods [12,29]. The conducted analysis showed a significant increase in Internet usersâ€™ interest in the term â€œHIVâ€ during the war compared to the time before the armed conflict. Due to the influx of refugees in Eastern European countries, it is crucial to strengthen HIV prevention and monitoring activities in these regions [31].

Several million people, mainly women and children, have decided to flee the war, seeking a safe asylum in neighboring countries, or have moved from eastern to western parts of the country [32,33,34]. According to data from 3 January 2023, there were 7,915,287 registered refugees from Ukraine throughout Europe [35]. The extent of the displacement is not yet clear; the numbers may escalate further. Most of the displaced persons and refugees are women and children. These people are particularly exposed to the risk of sexual violence, sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, and unwanted pregnancies [2,12]. Another problem during war is sexual violence, which affects people both in war-affected areas and people fleeing [32,33,36]. The analysis in our study showed a significant increase in interest in the term â€œrapeâ€ during the war compared to the period before it. However, there was no significant difference in the interest in the term â€œsexual violenceâ€ in the analyzed time periods. Increasing the availability of contraceptive methods as well as appropriate education are necessary to reduce the rate of unplanned pregnancies and abortions among Ukrainian women [18]. Abortion is legally available in Ukraine during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy; from 12 to 28 weeks for a variety of reasons, including medical, social and personal; and for any reason following approval from the medical board [3]. Abortion is free, but if additional treatment is needed or complications occur, such as infection or prolonged bleeding, women must pay for it themselves. Medical abortion using mifepristone and misoprostol is also available in Ukraine, but it is expensive and all drugs are paid for by the woman [18]. In 1995, the abortion rate in Ukraine was among the highest in Europe. According to official abortion statistics, abortion rates dropped from 41.3% in 1995â€“2000 to 9.3% in 2009â€“2010 [18,20]. According to the Ministry of Healthcare of Ukraine (MHC), the number of abortions in 2019 reached 74,606, including 727 abortions in minor individuals [37]. However, in the face of war, access to abortion is significantly limited, and the conditions in which it is carried out may raise many concerns [12]. Our study did not show any significant difference in the interest of Internet users in the term â€œabortionâ€ in the analyzed time periods. Sexual and reproductive health and rights needs are a serious concern in Ukraine. Access to medical facilities in the field of obstetrics is also a problem; many women are forced to give birth in difficult conditions without proper care, for example, in basements and bomb shelters. Women during pregnancy and in the perinatal period are exposed to direct hazards to themselves and their offspring [2,3,36]. Another important problem is the safety and future of newborns born via surrogacy. The war in Ukraine put pregnant women, future parents and newborns in a very difficult situation. Ukraine is considered an international center of surrogacy; it is one of a few countries in the world that legally allows foreigners to enter into surrogacy contracts [3,12]. Our study did not show a significant difference in the interest of Ukrainian Internet users in the keywords â€œsurrogate motherhoodâ€ and â€œsurrogate motherâ€ in the analyzed time periods. Before the war, the Internet in Ukraine was well developed and access to it was constantly growing [38,39]. In 2011, 33.9% of Ukrainian citizens (15.3 million users) had access to the Internet, while in 2012, 36.8% of Ukrainians had access [40]. In January 2021, approximately 30 million Ukrainians (85% of the countryâ€™s population aged over 15) were Internet users [41]. In September 2020, Ukraine was ranked 59th among the countries in the world in terms of broadband speed. The median speed of the Internet network in Ukraine in November 2022 for the mobile network was as follows: download 11.23 Mbit/s, upload 7.50 Mbit/s. For the broadband network, the median speed was as follows: download 60.00 Mbit/s, upload 62.67 Mbit/s. [42]. Google Trends is an objective data source increasingly used in healthcare research [43]. These trends have been particularly useful in assessing the general awareness of public health issues [44,45]. The study of Sousa-Pinto et al., the purpose of which was to assess whether GT data related to COVID-19 were all related to media coverage or epidemic trends, indicated that GT data related to COVID-19 are more closely related to media coverage than to epidemic trends. Similar results were obtained in the study of Datt et al., which showed a significant increase in the interest in contraception among Internet users in the GT in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade being overturned in 2022 [46,47]. Equally interesting results were obtained in the Guldi study, which showed that the teenage birth rate decreased with greater access to information through broadband access, the results being in line with other studies on the influence of media on teenage fertility [48]. Sexual and reproductive health issues are concerns not only for those facing the war situation in Ukraine, but also for millions of people who have become migrants and refugees in neighboring countries in a matter of days [12]. It is important to respect, protect and implement the sexual and reproductive health, needs and rights of all those affected by the war in Ukraine [3]. Therefore, it is imperative that further efforts are made to ensure the availability of sexual and reproductive health services.

Google Trends is a free and easily accessible way to access big search data to gain meaningful insights into population health behavior [49]. The main advantage of GT is that the data are available in real time and that users can obtain data that would be difficult or impossible to obtain. Due to the confidentiality of online searches, it is possible to analyze and predict sensitive diseases and topics such as AIDS [50].

Despite the large number of studies on GT over the past decade in healthcare research, there are no guidelines or agreed standards for the appropriate use of this tool, and the literature on the subject lacks a specific methodological framework [42,51].

There are also some limitations on how GT data can be used. The sample size is not clear and cannot be shown to be representative. Internet searches do not provide reliable results in places where there are obstacles to Internet access or freedom of expression [52]. It is also important to bear in mind that media reports and unexpected events can affect the reliability of results. Additional demographic characteristics, such as age and gender, are not included in the study, as the sample size is unknown [53].

While GT and other search engine databases will never replace traditional methods of obtaining information, if properly validated, GT data can become an important and complementary source of additional data for researchers and decision makers investigating unique topics and challenges at local, national and global levels [49].",5/25/2023 0:00,en,Real

President Donald Trump is facing intense criticism over a July phone call during which, according to a person familiar with the matter, he pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate to face him in the 2020 presidential election.

Under fire, Trump has revived one of his favorite defensive tactics: trying to turn the spotlight onto his opponent.

Trump has made a series of allegations about Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden over the last week. The essence of Trumpâ€™s argument is that Joe Biden was improperly trying to help Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, when Joe Biden pressured the Ukrainian government to fire the countryâ€™s prosecutor general.

But there are significant holes in Trumpâ€™s story. Some of his allegations have been false. Others have been missing important context.

Trumpâ€™s missing context: What happened with the Ukrainian prosecutor

In castigating Bidenâ€™s effort to get the prosecutor general fired, Trump has declined to mention an important fact: a whole lot of other people were also trying to get him fired at the time.

The Obama administration, American allies, the International Monetary Fund and Ukrainian anti-corruption activists, among others, had all made clear that they were displeased with the performance of Viktor Shokin, who became prosecutor general in 2015.

Shokin was widely faulted for declining to bring prosecutions of elitesâ€™ corruption, and he was even accused of hindering corruption investigations. His deputy, Vitaliy Kasko, resigned in February 2016, alleging that Shokinâ€™s office was itself corrupt.

The International Monetary Fund warned Ukraine in February 2016 that it risked losing financial support if it did not clean up its act. The Financial Times explained in its article on the warning that then-President Petro Poroshenko was facing pressure to replace Shokin, whom the newspaper described as a â€œlong-time loyalistâ€ of the president; the article continued, â€œMr. Shokin has been criticized for failing to bring to justice any of the snipers who killed dozens of protesters in central Kiev in the final days of the revolution, and for dragging his feet over investigating senior officials and businesspeople.â€

In a September 2015 speech, the US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, used blunt language in criticizing Shokin, blasting â€œcorrupt actors within the Prosecutor Generalâ€™s Officeâ€ who were â€œmaking things worse by openly and aggressively undermining reform.â€ Then, during a visit to Ukraine, Biden, who had long handled Ukraine issues for the Obama administration, applied public and private pressure on the government.

In a speech to Ukraineâ€™s legislature, Biden said, â€œThe Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform.â€

The most detailed account of Bidenâ€™s private words comes from Biden himself. At a Council on Foreign Relations event in 2018, he recounted that he had threatened to withhold a â€œbillion-dollar loan guaranteeâ€ unless Poroshenko followed through on what Biden said was a â€œcommitmentâ€ to â€œtake action against the state prosecutor.â€

â€œI looked at them and said: â€˜Iâ€™m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, youâ€™re not getting the money.â€™ Well, son of a bitch. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time,â€ Biden said.

The timeline here is fuzzy: Shokin was not actually terminated while Biden was in the country, as Bidenâ€™s story made it sound. Ukraineâ€™s legislature voted to fire Shokin in March 2016; Bidenâ€™s last visit to Ukraine before the firing was in December 2015. Biden did have a phone call with Poroshenko the week before the dismissal.

Biden spokesman Andrew Bates told CNN that Shokinâ€™s removal was a â€œfocusâ€ for Biden â€œduring numerous trips and phone conversations,â€ since the prosecutor was such a major impediment to anti-corruption efforts.

What Trump has been getting wrong

Trump is free to criticize Hunter Biden for taking a position with a Ukrainian company at the same time as his father was directly involved in Ukrainian issues. And Trump is free to criticize Joe Biden for declining to recuse himself from a matter that could conceivably have affected his sonâ€™s interests.

But Trump has been inaccurate about some of the key facts of the situation.

Claim 1: Trump says Biden called for the firing of a prosecutor â€œinvestigating his sonâ€

Trump has repeatedly claimed Shokin was investigating Hunter Biden. For example, Trump alleged Saturday that the media wants to avoid talking about the â€œJoe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his sonâ€¦â€

But there is no public evidence that Hunter Biden was ever himself under investigation.

The investigation, as far as we know, was into the business activities of Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned a natural gas company, Burisma Holdings, for which Hunter Biden had sat on the board of directors since 2014. The United Kingdom had begun investigating Zlochevsky before Hunter Biden joined the board.

â€œHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws â€“ at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing,â€ Shokinâ€™s successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg. Of a 2013 business transaction that was part of the investigation, Lutsenko said, â€œ(Hunter) Biden was definitely not involved. We do not have any grounds to think that there was any wrongdoing starting from 2014.â€

It is not clear how hard Shokin was investigating even Zlochevsky or Burisma at the time Joe Biden pushed for Shokinâ€™s firing. Kasko, the prosecutor who resigned from Shokinâ€™s office, told Bloomberg that the case was dormant at the time of Joe Bidenâ€™s intervention: â€œThere was no pressure from anyone from the US to close cases against Zlochevsky. It was shelved by Ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.â€

Shokin told The Hill for an April 2019 article that he had made â€œspecific plansâ€ before his firing that â€œincluded interrogations and other crime-investigation procedures into all members of the executive board, including Hunter Biden.â€

But his assertion that the investigation was active has been challenged.

â€œShokin was not investigating. He didnâ€™t want to investigate Burisma,â€ Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraineâ€™s Anti-Corruption Action Center, told the Washington Post for a July article. â€œAnd Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.â€

Claim 2: Trump says Biden told Ukraine to take Shokin off the case

â€œSomebody ought to look into Joe Bidenâ€™s statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that heâ€™s not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case,â€ Trump said last week.

There is no evidence Biden ever called for Shokin to be â€œtaken off the case.â€ In fact, there is no evidence that Biden mentioned the case at all when discussing Shokin with Ukrainian officials. Rather, Biden generally pressured the Ukrainians to fire Shokin, according to reporting from multiple news outlets and Bidenâ€™s own account of what happened.

Trumpâ€™s allies might argue that calling for the prosecutorâ€™s firing was even worse than calling for him to be taken off a particular case. But there is a key difference given the context.

Had Biden called for Shokin to be taken off a particular matter in which his son had a stake, this would seem to suggest that his motivation was helping his son. But Biden calling for Shokinâ€™s firing, without mentioning that particular case, was consistent with the international concern about Shokinâ€™s performance.

Claim 3: Trump says Joe Biden previously said he spoke to Hunter Biden about Hunterâ€™s business dealings

Biden said Saturday, â€œI have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.â€ Trump responded Sunday, â€œHe also said, long before, that he did speak to his son. So he lied, again.â€

Biden has not previously said that he did speak to his son about his overseas business dealings. Rather, it was Hunter Biden who said that there was a conversation on the subject, according to a New Yorker article in July.

That article said this: â€œAs Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: â€˜Dad said, â€œI hope you know what you are doing,â€ and I said, â€œI do.â€™â€

Once is more than never, so Trump can fairly point out the contradiction â€“ though the New Yorker article did not offer evidence that the father-son exchange was detailed. Regardless, the elder Biden was not contradicting himself; he was contradicting his son.

Claim 4: The amount of money at issue

Trump has repeatedly alleged that Biden threatened to deny Ukraine â€œbillions of dollars.â€ According to Biden, it was a $1 billion loan guarantee. (Less than three months after Shokin was fired, Obama agreed to approve a $1 billion guarantee.)

We donâ€™t have independent confirmation of what was discussed, so itâ€™s possible that Biden had also raised the subject of additional funds.

One general caveat: it is possible that weâ€™ll generally learn more about Hunter Bidenâ€™s work in Ukraine and about the firing of Shokin. But what we know right now shows significant factual problems with Trumpâ€™s theories.",9/23/2019 0:00,en,Real

USA TODAY Sports

A fisherman is being hailed a hero after he used his fishing skills to rescue an 11-year-old boy who was trapped atop a small ice floe on the Desenka River in the city of Kyiv in Ukraine.

The boy, who somehow became stranded on the ice, couldnâ€™t swim. Richard Gorda, the angler, kept him calm by telling him, â€œStand still, donâ€™t moveâ€¦Donâ€™t be afraidâ€¦Donâ€™t turn around. Look at me.â€

Gorda made a cast with a hookless weight to the boy, who grabbed the line, held on tight and followed Gordaâ€™s instructions. He didnâ€™t move.

Two videos show the rescue, one by Reuters via Twitter from the angler, the other from a bystander who posted it on Facebook.

Ukraineâ€™s Independent Information Agency of News (UNIAN) reported that the â€œterrifiedâ€ boy was drifting on the piece of ice â€œdozens of meters off the shore.â€

UNIAN also stated that Gorda directed adults present at the scene to call emergency services, as the river depth at that spot was 65-feet deep.

Turns out, emergency services were not needed because Gorda pulled the boy ashore without incident, but he admonished the youth, telling him, â€œItâ€™s over now, but you deserve to get a spanking.â€

Gorda told UNIAN he doesnâ€™t consider himself a hero and said heâ€™s done things like this before.

""There is no feat, we just turned out to be in the right place and at the right moment,â€ Gorda told UNIAN. â€œThe fact that I cast [the spinning rod] and hit at once is God's mercy. I might have had time for another try. The ice piece was cracking under that boy. The child didn't even get wet or anything, he's safe and sound, but he will learn that lesson for life.â€

Rick Rozoff

In recent months all U.S. geographical and several other military commands have branded Russia an adversary in all parts of the world, from the Arctic to the Antarctic, from South America to North Africa, from West Asia to Eastern Europe, from cyberspace to outer space.

To demonstrate how comprehensive, how obsessive, the accusation is, here are compendious specimens:

Africa Command, Central Command, European Command, Indo-Pacific Command (p. 6-9). Northern Command, Southern Command (p. 31-38), Space Command, Strategic Command, Defense Intelligence Agency, State Department and American intelligence agencies.

And what is the nation supposedly posing such an existential threat to global peace and security? A country of 145 million people, only 43% of that of the U.S. The combined population of nations constituting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is 1 billion, seven times that of Russia. Last year Russiaâ€™s military budget was under $62 billion. The U.S. military budget for next year is projected to be $753 billion, over twelve times as large as Russiaâ€™s. NATOâ€™s joint annual military spending is over $1 trillion. The U.S. divides up the entire surface of the planet between six regional military commands and as many naval fleets, the latter including eleven nuclear-powered supercarriers. The area of responsibility for Russiaâ€™s military commands is strictly Russia and its territorial waters. It has one, non-nuclear, aircraft carrier. Russia doesnâ€™t belong to any military alliance. The U.S. heads up the only one in the world, one with thirty members and forty partners.

Russia has military personnel in Syria and small peacekeeping contingents in Abkhazia, Armenia, South Ossetia, Tajikistan and Transdniester. The U.S. has scores, by some counts hundreds, of military bases and installations on every inhabited continent. Yet Washington and NATO, the global military bloc it created and controls, assert that Russia is the main threat to world peace and have convinced much of the world of that contention.

Statements emanating from NATO Headquarters in Belgium in recent weeks have provided a uniform narrative portraying Russia as expanding its alleged military aggression further and further afield from former Soviet space. Until recently charges of said Russian aggression were limited to its role in South Ossetia and Georgia in 2008 and in Ukraine since 2014. Now the indictment is substantially broader.

In the middle of last month the military chiefs of Georgia and Ukraine, significantly enough, were invited to attend a meeting of NATOâ€™s Military Committee in a chiefs of defense format in Brussels. (In 2012 NATO held a chiefs of defense staff meeting with the military leaders of 67 nations.) The two Black Sea nations were both promised eventual NATO membership at the NATO summit in Romania in 2008, were both granted successive NATO Annual National Programmes starting later that year and became NATO Enhanced Opportunities Partners last year.

The U.S., NATO and the European Union accuse Russia of â€œoccupyingâ€ Abkhazia and South Ossetia, formerly parts of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic but never that of contemporary Georgia, and Crimea and by extension the Donetsk and Lugansk republics in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine. American and NATO officially have lately referred to those entities as occupied territories. As occupied territories they presumably must be returned to their rightful owners. As a stark historical parallel, in 1939 the government of Germany considered the Danzig Corridor and Alsace-Lorraine to be occupied German territories. A year later the Wehrmacht was in Warsaw and Paris.

At the NATO Military Committee meeting last month Ukraineâ€™s Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Ruslan Khomchak, said this to the military leaders of NATOâ€™s thirty member states: â€œ[E]very day brings us signs of a new â€˜coldâ€™ war. At the same time, we are talking about potential conflicts that may arise not only in Europe but also in the Arctic, the Middle East, North and Central Africa, the Mediterranean, etc. â€“ wherever Russia demonstrates aggressive ambitions and military power, provokes instability and creates areas of tension.â€

The chairman of NATOâ€™s Military Committee, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach (who visited Georgia and Ukraine in April), said on the occasion: â€œThis afternoon, the chiefs of staff of the Allies met with their Ukrainian and Georgian counterparts. Russia continues to show a steady trend of destabilizing behavior, including violations of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia.â€

On May 31 NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg answered a reporterâ€™s question regarding Russia during a press conference at the military blocâ€™s headquarters in these words:

â€œFirst on the Belarussian officials. We are constantly assessing security measures here at NATO and we have decided to restrict the access of Belarussian personnel to the NATO headquarters based on our assessment of security measures at the headquarters. Then on Russia, what we see is a pattern of Russian behavior where Russia over the last years have [sic] invested heavily in new modern military capabilities, from conventional to nuclear weapon systems. But not only that, but Russia has been willing to use military force against neighbours, in Georgia and Ukraine, increasing and continuing to destabilise Donbass in Eastern Ukraine and illegally annexing Crimea.

â€œAnd then weâ€™ve seen more Russian military presence in the High North, in the Barents Sea, and in the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad, the Black Sea, and also down to the Mediterranean and Middle East. [Emphasis added] And this is one of the main reasons why NATO over the last years has increased the readiness of our forces and also why we have deployed battlegroups to the eastern part of the Alliance. Germany is leading one of them in Lithuania. NATO is a defensive Alliance, and NATO is there to protect and defend all Allies. And we are there to prevent conflict and war. But the best way of doing that is to send a clear message to any potential adversary that if one Ally is attacked, the whole Alliance will be thereâ€¦.â€

The references by Khomchak and Stoltenberg employing a suspiciously similar list of geographical locations, to the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Middle East and Africa transparently indicate that evicting the Russian Black Sea Fleet from Sevastopol in Crimea would solve the problem.

The Diia mobile app â€” and its accompanying online e-services portal â€” allows citizens to digitize their national ID and biometric passport, personal tax number, student ID, and more, and the digital documents wield the same legal power as the original paper ones. Within a year, Ukraine became the fourth European country to have a digital driverâ€™s license and the first country in the world to have a digital passport.

However, a massive data leak last year has raised concerns about the level of protection around usersâ€™ personal information. In May 2020, activists discovered about 900 GB of citizensâ€™ personal data being traded by an anonymous chatbot on the popular messaging platform Telegram. The dataset included passport numbers, personal tax numbers, residence information, driverâ€™s licenses, social media passwords, and even bank details of millions of Ukrainians.

Some public officials accused Diia of leaking data from government registries, while security experts recalled that the Ministry of Digital Transformation had yet to release any security documentation for the app. While journalists and researchers were able to confirm that part of the datasets had come from Ukrainian government registries, no evidence implicating Diia directly has been found.

On the anniversary of its launch, Diia app boasts over 6 million users. At the same time, IT specialists and digital rights defenders continue to call on the government to consider all of the risks that e-government and digital identification technology carry, as these may potentially undermine the public's trust.

Digitizing the nation

While the idea of digitizing public services is not new to Ukraine, Zelensky's is the first administration that has made e-governance a top priority or established a separate ministry entirely dedicated to it â€” the Ministry of Digital Transformation, headed by Mykhailo Fedorov.

Originally presented in the spring of 2019, the ambitious â€œState in a Smartphoneâ€ program envisioned moving all public services online and providing the majority of the citizens with a means of digital identification. It was later expanded to include goals such as increasing people's digital literacy, expanding internet infrastructure, and creating favorable conditions for the development of the information technology (IT) industry.

If implemented successfully, the program could help combat corruption by minimizing the interference and arbitrary decisions of public officials, while significantly reducing state bureaucracy.

In addition, Minister Fedorov has proudly noted that not a single hryvnya from the state budget had been spent on the development of the Diia app â€” its development team comprised 35 volunteers from the well-known software engineering company EPAM Systems. They later transferred the completed product and relevant technical know-how to the state.

How secure are citizensâ€™ data in Ukraine?

Initially, the ministry announced that Diia used BankID technology from several leading Ukrainian banks for user authorization, and that it utilized a secure cloud server for the transfer of encrypted data.

Still, few disclosures were made about the security of citizensâ€™ personal data on the app, and security specialists cautiously noted that not enough was known about Diia's security testing.

No independent security audit seemed to have been performed, for example â€” hardly acceptable for technology to which millions of citizens would be entrusting their personal information. In fact, the app's first public bug bounty program was not launched until December 2020.

The leaks have made clear that the standard of data security at the state level in Ukraine remains inadequate â€” including a weak legal data protection regime, poor enforcement, and the lack of appropriate protection measures within state institutions themselves. Synchronization of data from various government registries into one portal or app is therefore likely to result in additional vulnerabilities to external attacks.

Moreover, in December 2019, the government granted the Ministry of Internal Affairs the power to verify and aggregate citizensâ€™ data from multiple state registries, providing the law enforcement body with access to data from at least five government registries, including those that handle civil, tax, social security, healthcare and voter information. Alarmingly, the data sharing was to be carried out as a part of an â€œexperimentalâ€ process that lacked comprehensive legal safeguards ensuring citizensâ€™ right to privacy.

Whereas in the case of digital display of documents in smartphones, â€˜experimentalâ€™ access to information is carried out with the consent of users, albeit without full compliance with the principle of legal certainty, the transfer of personal data from state registries to the interior ministry in another experiment, with neither the consent of citizens nor any independent control, contradicts the requirements of current legislation and the Constitution of Ukraine.

Christoph and I are back for another jam packed episode of Porkins Great Game. We begin by discussing the new direction that we will be taking the show in. Christoph and I explain why we will be focusing less on Central Asia and the Caucuses, and more on the the â€œglobal rimland.â€ We then move onto a discussion of the influential book The Unquiet Frontier by A Wess Mitchell and Jakub Grygiel. We talk about who Mitchell and Gryiel are, their careers at the Center for European Policy Analysis, and their current positions with in the State Department. Christoph and I then explore what is actually in The Unquiet Frontier and why it is such an important book. We talk about their theory of the global rimland and the policies that Mitchell and Gryiel lay out for the US empire. Next we talk about how these polices are quite identical to Trumpâ€™s foreign policy. We also touch on Trumpâ€™s recent foreign policy speech which appears to have been heavily influenced by The Unquiet Frontier.

Next Christoph and I talk about the recent political developments in Ukraine. We focus specifically on the recent assassination of Chechen fighter Timur Makhauri in Kiev. We talk about who Makhauri was and his complex history with Georgia and their security services. Christoph talks about the chaos that Ukraine has been plunged into since the US backed revolution. The two of us discuss how Kiev has been turned into a hot bed for Chechen terrorists, hitman, and all sorts of unsavory characters. Christoph also gives us his perspective as to what might be in store for Katharine in the near future.

We finish of the episode by turning to our favorite former Georgian Prime Minister Mikheil Saakashvilli, and his recent troubles in his adoptive home of Odessa. We chronicle Saakashvilliâ€™s rise and fall as governor of the Odessa Oblast. We focus on his bombastic nature and his clashes with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Chistoph and I then move onto Saakashvilliâ€™s insane arrest in Kiev, his escape from a police van, and his eventual re-arrest. We talk about what this means for Saakashvilli in the near future, and how his fate is identical to every other authoritarian leader who has aligned themselves with the US.

He likened the idea of Novorossiya â€” the term invoked by Russian nationalists for breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine â€” to a realm in the fantasy universe of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" the popular trilogy written by the late J.R.R. Tolkien and eventually made into a Hollywood blockbuster.

""Ukraine existed, exists and will exist. But Novorossiya is the same myth as famous writer Tolkien's Mordor,"" Poroshenko said.



Mordor, for those who don't know, is the fell domain of Tolkien's great villain, Sauron. It's shrouded in darkness, guarded by towering black gates and populated by ranks of monstrous orcs and other, even nastier creatures.

""It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire, ash, and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume,"" intones one of Tolkien's characters in the film. ""There is evil there that does not sleep.""

Poroshenko's reference to Mordor doesn't come out of nowhere. As Bloomberg View's Leonid Bershidsky noted in an article last year, some in Kiev have peddled this image of a big, bad Russia resembling Mordor, while conjuring Ukraine as something like the pastoral, innocent Shire, full of well-meaning little Hobbits.

The analogy got particular attention last December when a Russian company briefly contemplated installing a holographic ""Eye of Sauron"" â€” the fiery, all-seeing orb of the dread lord â€” atop a Moscow skyscraper.

But Tolkien, the late British author and academic, rejected earlier interpretations of his text that connected the evil of the ""East"" with Stalinist Russia. ""The situation was conceived long before the Russian revolution. Such allegory is entirely foreign to my thought,"" he wrote in a letter to his publishers in 1961, cited by Bershidsky. ""The placing of Mordor in the east was due to simple narrative and geographical necessity, within my 'mythology.' ""

Whatever the case, Russia â€” or at least a historical concept related to Russia â€” is hardly the only place on this planet that has been linked to Tolkien's Mordor. Here are other mooted spots.

New Zealand

The films, directed by Peter Jackson, were shot in New Zealand. Mordor, in Jackson's rendering, was placed within the desolate landscape that surrounds the three great volcanoes of Tongariro National Park. In 2012, there were fears that one of the volcanoes in the park would erupt, belching fire and ash like Mordor's Mount Doom in Tolkien's tale.

Transylvania

Trascau - Apuseni Mountains, Transylvania, Romania pic.twitter.com/9qp0YTQROQ â€” Mira Kaliani (@MiraKaliani) August 15, 2015

A UCLA cartographer mapped all of Middle Earth as if it would appear on our planet and placed Mordor in Transylvania, that spooky vale in the shadow of the Carpathian Mountains.

Rajasthan

The name given to a parched desert region in the western Indian state of Rajasthan â€” Marwar â€” translates as ""land of death."" The area's huge fortresses and empty expanses carry an echo of Tolkien's epic.

Italy

According to a sci-fi fanzine cited in the Guardian, Tolkien felt he had caught a glimpse of Mount Doom while on a cruise in the Mediterranean, where he sailed past the Sicilian island of Stromboli, home to one of the world's most active volcanoes.

Britain's Black Country

But the most likely inspiration for Tolkien's dark realm was a far less exotic locale. The allegory of evil in Tolkien's universe had less to do with geography than a bending and twisting of nature. Mordor is all smoke and pollution, bellowing furnaces and blackening land. This was, in part, Tolkien's reaction to industrialization. And its mark could be seen especially in areas around the city of Birmingham, the home of Tolkien's parents. A recent exhibition in the nearby city of Wolverhampton linked images from Tolkien's sketchbooks to depictions of the Black Country, a region northwest of Birmingham once known for its coal mines, steel mills and stretches of industrial blight.",8/25/2015 0:00,en,Real

Cada viernes los periodistas de los diferentes idiomas de euronews recopilan una selecciÃ³n de temas que no ocupan los grandes titulares, tanto de Europa como del resto del mundo.

â€œMcRusiaâ€ o cÃ³mo acabar con las hamburguesas imperialistas

Los directores de cine rusos Nikita Mikhalkov y Andrey Konchalovskiy han pedido al presidenet ruso Vladimir Putin casi mil millones de rublos, unos 17,5 millones de euros, para crear una cadena rusa de comida rÃ¡pida. El objetivo, vencer a McDonaldâ€™s, â€œofreciendo una alternativa a las cadenas de comida rÃ¡pida occidentalesâ€.

Se basarÃ­a en productos regionales y podrÃ­a prestar servicios de catering a escuelas, entre otras instituciones.

Los promotores de la idea dicen que el proyecto quedarÃ­a amortizado en menos de cinco aÃ±os.

El nombre de la empresa puede traducirse como â€œComemos en casaâ€, una marca ya registrada por la esposa de Konchalovskiy, la actriz Yulia Vysotskaya, conocida por sus programas televisivos de cocina y libros de recetas. TambiÃ©n posee un par de restaurantes en MoscÃº.

Se desconoce aÃºn la respuesta de Putin.

VÃ­deo viral en Grecia: cÃ³mo robar una moto en solo dos minutos

Un vÃ­deo en internet que muestra a dos personas robando una moto se convierte en viral en Grecia. El vehÃ­culo estaba aparcado, bloqueado y cubierto por una funda, lo que no supuso ningÃºn obstÃ¡culo para los hÃ¡biles ladrones. En solo dos minutos y treinta segundos consiguieron llevÃ¡rselo.

Las cÃ¡maras de seguridad grabaron el delito. El vÃ­deo fue subido a la red por el propietario de la motocicleta, que pide a los internautas que le ayuden a localizarla.

La mÃ¡xima autoridad religiosa de TurquÃ­a declara que el papel higiÃ©nico y el Islam son compatibles

El Directorio de Asuntos Religiosos de TurquÃ­a ha publicado una fetua que establece que el uso de papel higiÃ©nico estÃ¡ permitida en el Islam, aunque enfatiza en la necesidad de que se utilice primero agua para limpiar las partes del cuerpo involucradas.

Recuerda que para que los rezos sean religiosamente vÃ¡lidos tanto el cuerpo y la ropa del orante como el lugar donde se encuentra deben estar libres de elementos definidos como â€œimpurosâ€ por el Islam.

Si no se dispone de agua, pueden emplearse otros materiales de limpieza. Incluso aunque algunas fuentes consideren que el papel no constituye un producto adecuado por ser un objeto utilizado para la escritura, la fetua asegura que no supone ningÃºn problema utilizarlo.

Portugal recauda mÃ¡s de un millÃ³n y medio de euros en un mes y medio gracias a los impuestos sobre las bolsas de plÃ¡stico

Este aÃ±o Portugal ha comenzado a aplicar un nuevo impuesto sobre las bolsas de plÃ¡stico vendidas por los comerciantes a sus clientes para llevar la compra. Durante el perÃ­odo de transiciÃ³n â€“ del uno de enero al quince de febrero â€“ el Estado habrÃ­a ganado 1,6 millones de euros gracias a la nueva tasa.

El Gobierno luso ha prohibido ofrecer gratis estas bolsas, como hacÃ­a la cadena de supermercados Continente. TambiÃ©n ha impuesto el pago de diez cÃ©ntimos, IVA incluido, por cada una de ellas que dispongan de asa y de un grosor igual o superior a los 0,05 mm.

El ejecutivo ha hecho sus propias cuentas y calcula que podrÃ­a obtener unos cuarenta millones de euros a lo largo de todo el aÃ±o con la venta de las bolsas.

El calvario de una mujer directiva en el Reino Unido

Una mujer directiva de un banco, vÃ­ctima de bulling y acoso sexual en el trabajo, obtiene 3,2 millones de libras de indemnizaciÃ³n tras denunciar los hechos a un tribunal laboral. Sus colegas la llamaban â€œla loca cabeza de cocaâ€ y difundÃ­an a sus espaldas rumores sobre su supuesta adicciÃ³n a la cocaÃ­na, de que vivÃ­a del dinero de su padre o de que solo habÃ­a sido contratada por el poder de su busto.

Svetlana Lokhova, de 33 aÃ±os, trabajaba para las oficinas en Londres del mayor banco ruso, el Sberbank CIB.

Un estudiante alemÃ¡n pide a un tribunal conocer las preguntas de selectividad antes del examen

Un estudiante de la localidad de MÃ¼nster, que realizarÃ¡ la selectividad en unas semanas, quiere conocer las preguntas que se le harÃ¡n en la prueba como parte del derecho a la Libertad de InformaciÃ³n.

El joven de 17 aÃ±os ha llevado a los tribunales su peticiÃ³n realizada a las autoridades educativas para que le den las preguntas de los exÃ¡menes, citando la â€œley de libertad de informaciÃ³nâ€ en su demanda oficial.

El Gobierno regional ha contestado que necesita mÃ¡s tiempo para estudiar la cuestiÃ³n. Pero las autoridades educativas ni se plantean publicar por adelantado el cuestionario de la prueba.

Abrazos contra el racismo en HungrÃ­a

En HungrÃ­a, un hombre gitano ha elegido una extraÃ±a forma de manifestarse contra el racismo. PermaneciÃ³ con los ojos vendados en una de las principales plazas del centro de Budapest con un cartel en la mano en el que se podÃ­a leer: â€œSoy gitano. Muchos de ustedes creen que soy un delincuente. Yo confÃ­o en ustedes. Si ustedes confÃ­an en mÃ­, denme un abrazoâ€. Su acciÃ³n aparece en este vÃ­deo.

En una hora recibiÃ³ veinte abrazos. La idea procedÃ­a de un vÃ­deo canadiense, en la que un hombre musulmÃ¡n hacÃ­a la misma propuesta.

En HungrÃ­a la minorÃ­a gitana es vÃ­ctima de un gran racismo.

El mal uso y el fraude del dinero pÃºblico costaron a Italia 4 000 millones de euros en 2014

AsÃ­ lo ha asegurado el informe anual elaborado por la policÃ­a econÃ³mica italiana publicado este miÃ©rcoles, que recalca que uno de cada tres contratos pÃºblicos son asignados de forma ilegal.

La imagen tuiteada muestra un viaducto en Sicilia que une Palermo y Agrigento, que costÃ³ trece millones de euros y se hundiÃ³ ocho dÃ­as despuÃ©s de ser inaugurado.

Ucrania: Haz los estudios, no la guerra

Estudiantes, posgraduados y doctorandos pueden evitar ser llamados a filas bajo una nueva ley aprobada por el Parlamento ucraniano.

La decisiÃ³n fue aprobada por 245 diputados de los 350 presentes en la sesiÃ³n.

Salvado de sÃ­ mismo en Egipto

Un trabajador egipcio escalÃ³ por una torre de comunicaciones amenazando con suicidarse. Estaba angustiado porque su empresa habÃ­a rechazado su solicitud de traslado a otra ciudad.

Los mÃ©dicos tambiÃ©n escalaron y le convencieron de no saltar despuÃ©s de que la compaÃ±Ã­a le prometiera reconsiderar su peticiÃ³n. La escena fue grabada y publicada por la web i2arabic.com.

In this scenario, it is an accident that causes Beatles amnesia.

In the case of the Democratsâ€™ obsession with Russiagate, a propaganda narrative delivered to and amplified by willing accessories in the mainstream media (MSM) through the initiative of the Central Intelligence Agency, there is a massive memory shutdown of just who the CIA actually is. This is the agency that has run US foreign policy for more than 70 years with a program of political destabilization, assassinations, lying to Congress about their illegal operations throughout the world, including the fabrication of Iraqâ€™s supposed WMD program, spying on members of the Senate, and regularly dishing out black propaganda and disinformation for MSM distribution.

The leadership of the Democrats in hopes of flipping the White House to their party control have partnered with the CIA and the likes of its former director John Brennan (2013-2017), who introduced the Russia â€œhackingâ€ story to the MSM in 2016. The Russian state, he claimed, had provided WikiLeaks with emails from the Democratic National Committee server that damaged the Clinton campaign and helped Trump win the election. The leaks included emails that exposed Clinton activities in securing quid pro quo deals with reactionary Middle East leaders in exchange for their large financial contributions to her and her husbandâ€™s private foundation.

They also exposed her collusion with the DNC for the purpose of undermining the presidential primary campaign of her rival Bernie Sanders and emails that showed that a longtime ally of Clinton and the DNC vice chair Donna Brazile had fed Clinton topics beforehand to be used in CNN â€œtown hallsâ€; that Clinton had a cozy relationship with Wall Street financial houses; that she in camera admitted that her public political statements contradicted her private beliefs; that she planned to invade and confront Russia in Syria; and that as a principle of foreign policy, she favored covert intervention in other countriesâ€™ affairs.

What the hawkish Clinton could not achieve, the less strident imperialist Joe Biden hopes to carry on. He comes from the same neoliberal and neoconservative mindset as the former first lady and secretary of state. As part of his campaign fundraising efforts to secure big bucks from big pocket corporations and billionaires, Biden recently assured the tycoon class that changing corporate behavior â€œis not going to require legislation â€“ [and] Iâ€™m not proposing any.â€ As a senator, he always played ball with Republicans and conservative Democrats, and thatâ€™s how he hopes to win over independents and anti-Trump conservatives to his side.

The Maidan coup in Ukraine in 2014, fomented by efforts to purge the government of its Russia-leaning leadership, has its roots in the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 2004, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) teamed up with the State Department, USAID, Freedom House, George Sorosâ€™s Open Society Institute, Britainâ€™s Westminster Institute, the political consultant Dick Morris, and other government groups, including the CIA, to block Viktor Yanukovych from taking office as president following an election in 2004, which the US and domestic enemies of Yanukovych branded as rigged. That year alone, according to the State Department, the US spent about $34 million on regime change initiatives in Ukraine, while Soros pitched in about $1.6 million in support of a local â€œFreedom of Choiceâ€ NGO coalition and Ukraineâ€™s â€œNew Choice 2004.â€

NED activists and Sorosâ€™s OSI employed a broad public relations strategy to aid a youth protest movement, bus paid out-of-town protesters into Kiev, create an online TV protest station, create agitation paraphernalia, and provide offshore training to the anti-Yanukovych student leadership based on a template â€œrevolutionaryâ€ strategy and the writings of Gene Sharp they had previously successfully employed in Serbia with a youth group called â€œOtpor.â€ They also paid local pollsters to do exit polls in favor of the US backed candidate, Viktor Yushchenko. One of the paid polling groups had USAID, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the U.S. State Department, and Coca-Cola among its former clients.

The US involvement in the so-called â€œcolor revolutionsâ€ in former Soviet-allied states is discussed in extensive detail in my 2010 book, Branding Democracy: U.S. Regime Change in Post-Soviet Eastern Europe and in a shorter version published in the UK.

The US found a second chance, starting in 2013, to rid the country of then president Yanukovych and played an active role in a coup against his government. This time around, apart from its other standard tactics, the US supported a much more violent section of the protest movement, involving neofascist organizations such as Svoboda and the Right Sector, which strongly identified with the pro-Nazi nationalist movement in that country during World War II. Vice President Bidenâ€™s relationship with Ukraine intensified at that time when he played a key role in the â€œMaidanâ€ uprising and the coup that overthrew Yanukovych.

This opened up the opportunity for State Department to install their anti-Russia choices for the new president and prime minister, respectively Viktor Poroshenko and Arseniy Yatsenyuk. Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT) and John McCain (R-AZ) showed up in the Maidan (square), where they shared the stage with the neo-Nazi Ukrainian leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, to cheer on the protesters. Once the neo-Nazi elements entered the Maidan and began to shoot police and throw gasoline bombs at government buildings, Yanukovych was forced to flee the country.

The assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs in the Obama administration, Victoria Nuland, a neocon, blatantly engaged in the protest, handing out cookies (let them eat cookies) to the demonstrators. This form of foreign intervention by public officials is unheard of. Nuland worked closely with the US ambassador in Kiev, Geoffrey Pyatt, to handpick Yanukovychâ€™s successors.

Nulandâ€™s husband, the neocon Robert Kagan, had earlier been one of the architects of the plan (with Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, John Bolton, Paul Wolfowitz, Eliot Abrams, Richard Perle and other hawks and chicken hawks) under the Project for a New American Century to invade Iraq. Nuland and Kagan must have had intense pillow talk on the tactics of regime change.

While the Maidan protest was underway, in December 2013 Nuland spoke before the International Business Conference, a group sponsored by the US-Ukrainian Foundation, where she bragged that Washington had â€œinvestedâ€ more than $5 billion over the years in support of opposition forces, routed through NGOs, and in backing Ukraineâ€™s â€œEuropean aspirations.â€ A couple of months later she would be caught on tape with the US ambassador in Kiev arrogantly raging that the US should â€œfuck the EU.â€ The US doesnâ€™t influence foreign elections, it runs them.

Bidenâ€™s role in the Ukraine regime change, as Nuland put it, was to â€œmidwifeâ€ the new government into existence and thereby incorporate another eastern European satellite into Americaâ€™s orbit. This is what the neocons call â€œdemocracy promotion.â€ His efforts in Ukraine, however, proved disastrous.

Two years after the coup, Yatsenyuk, caught up in a corruption scandal and about to receive a vote of no-confidence, was forced to resign as prime minister. Later in 2016, after Poroshenkoâ€™s name was listed as one of the businessmen with offshore accounts hidden in the Panama tax haven, his trust rating sank to 13.7%, according to a poll by the Kiev International Institute of Sociology. Bidenâ€™s boys were busted. One can only imagine his reaction if Vladimir Putin had been involved in such a financial scandal and with such a low approval rating.

Poroshenko was well-known within the State Department for corruption as well as being a regular informant to the US embassy in Kiev years before he was put up for president. His dirty reputation didnâ€™t trouble Biden at all, as the vice president had his own family business deals to sow, with Poroshenko as an accomplice. Two months after the Maidan coup and his anointment as president, Poroshenkoâ€™s repayment was to shepherd Bidenâ€™s son, Hunter, onto the board and as head of legal affairs at Ukraineâ€™s largest gas producer, Burisma Holdings, run by the oligarch and former head of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, Mykola Zlochevsky.

Just two months after being booted out of the US Navy for cocaine use, Hunter was deemed fit to operate in Ukraineâ€™s political culture, which for many Ukrainians must have been a grave insult. It is more to Joe Bidenâ€™s discredit, however, that he encouraged his son to be part of a regime that was ranked in 2015 the most corrupt country in Europe, and, according to Ernst & Young, has the highest level of fraud of 41 countries they surveyed (2017) and ranked second in the world in bribery and corruption (2017).

Burismaâ€™s owner was notorious for using his high political position to convert privatized state assets into his personal coffers. The year and month young Biden was hired, April 2014, Zlochevsky came under the investigation of the governmentâ€™s Serious Fraud Office for money laundering, tax evasion, embezzlement, and corruption, including his stashing of $23.5 million in his London companies and money laundering operations in Cyprus and Latvia.

Zlochevsky was also investigated for handing out oil and gas licenses during his time as minister to companies that he then owned. According to a Reuters report, while acting as legal advisor to the company, Hunter Biden failed to give any legal help to Zlochevsky during the shakeup. Zlochevsky fled the country and was last known to be living in the Riviera.

Biden used his position as vice president to coerce Poroshenko into firing his prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, as a condition for a US underwriting of an IMF $1 billion loan to Ukraine, in addition to assuring Biden that Ukraine was putting through the unnamed political and economic reforms demanded by the US and the IMF, including raising tariffs on Russian gas imports. This was captured in series of leaked phone calls between the then vice president and Poroshenko.

During a visit to Ukraine in December 2015, Biden told the Ukraine president, â€œIâ€™m going to be leaving here in six hours. If the prosecutorâ€™s [Shokin] not fired, youâ€™re not getting the money.â€ Poroshenko, who owed his position to the Obama administration, followed orders. Biden later said triumphantly, â€œWell, son of a bitch, he got fired.â€ It was the height of imperial swagger.

Bidenâ€™s defenders claim that the demand for Shokinâ€™s sacking was simply to clean up the Ukraine government. However, a French documentary produced by the anti-corruption blog Les Crises indicates through extensive interviews with Ukrainian political leaders that Shokin, an experienced lawyer and respected by many within the countryâ€™s political circles for honesty, was the only state prosecutor who had actively investigated high-level corruption. Two months before he was fired, Shokin had the house of Zlochevsky raided and confiscated.

Biden and Zlochevsky desperately wanted him out not for incompetence, as Biden claimed, but because of the embarrassing details Shokin was discovering about Burismaâ€™s bribery and financial chicanery until Poroshenko ordered him to shut down the investigation. Shokinâ€™s replacement was Yuri Lutsenko, who prior to his appointment had been sentenced in 2012 to 4 years (serving 3) in prison for forgery and abuse of office.

In one of their phone calls, Poroshenko is heard asking permission from Biden to put Lutsenko in the prosecutorâ€™s office. Biden tells him he wants to â€œhuddle with my teamâ€ before giving approval. Three months into office, Lutsenko dropped the case against Zlochevsky.

Meanwhile, Poroshenko was making deals with Zlochevsky through an intermediary to end the prosecution against him in exchange for a major share of the profits from Burismaâ€™s companies. Poroshenkoâ€™s method was to threaten oligarchs whose properties he coveted with prosecution and then demand payoffs or cut profit-sharing deals with them. During his 5 years in power, Poroshenko never put in prison any of the oligarchs accused of corruption.

Along with his confectionary companies, â€œChocolate Kingâ€ Poroshenko, as he is known in Ukraine, had investments in car manufacturing, shipbuilding, armaments, and TV stations, controlling some 20-30% of the countryâ€™s media market. The â€œChocolate Kingâ€™sâ€ estimated worth is currently $1.4 billion.

Ousted from the presidency in 2019, his successor Volodymyr Zelensky is said to be under the patronage of another oligarch, Igor Kolomoisky, who is worth a trifling $1 billion.

While his son was ensconced at a very high salary in one of the most corrupt industries in Ukraine, Biden was busy lecturing the Ukraine parliament (Rada) in December 2015 that â€œsenior elected officials have to remove all conflicts between their business interest and their government responsibilities.â€ Adding to such sanctimonious malarkey, he said: â€œI never tell another man or another nation or another woman whatâ€™s in their interest.â€

The US does not regard its constant interventions in other countriesâ€™ affairs as â€œinterferenceâ€ when it has to do with US hegemonic power demands. Personal manipulation of foreign governments and their leaders is not at all considered illegitimate. Bidenâ€™s personal interest in Ukraine was that the prosecutor general Viktor Shokin was investigating Burisma Holdings and its owner Mykola Zlochevsky too studiously. Zlochevsky hired Bidenâ€™s son, Hunter, in 2014 to be a â€œceremonial figureâ€ on the board of directors of his energy company, with a monthly stipend of $83,000, according to Fox News ($50,000/month according to the Wall Street Journal).

Neither Biden nor anyone else in the State Department at the time saw any conflict of interest between a vice president acting as a proconsul to another country on behalf of US interests, while his own son, who had no previous experience in the energy field, was making hay at the expense of the Ukrainian people and American taxpayers funding US assistance to one of the most corrupt regimes on the planet.

During his time on the Burisma board and as its legal advisor (2014-2019), Hunter Biden never bothered to visit Ukraine.",8/10/2020 0:00,en,Real

Among other things, this dependence led to some parts of Southern and Eastern Ukraine being populated by Russian-born settlers and their descendants, which is still manifested in their historical and sociocultural orientation toward a closer integration with Russia. On the other hand, the notion of â€˜path dependenceâ€™ implies significant differences between Ukraine and Russia, especially due to many Ukrainians self-identifying as a European nation. The European self-identification of Ukrainians is apparent in the desire of the vast majority to overcome dependence on Russia through integration into the European political, legal, cultural, and economic system. We firmly believe that, to successfully overcome dependence on Russia, Ukraine and Ukrainians first need a fundamental recognition of European standards of human rights and the European human rights protection model in general. The success of the 2014â€“2018 democratic reforms in Ukraine is obvious, but no less obvious is the fact that the positive changes in Ukraine are far from irreversible.

Ukraine has decided to impose martial law in some areas of the country after three of its ships were seized by the Russian navy on Sunday.

23 sailors have been captured by Russia who accuse the Ukrainians of entering Russian waters along the Kerch Straigh, near Crimea.

There have been violent protests in Ukraine over the capture of the ships and their crew and Ukraineâ€™s parliament have decided to act, voting for martial law to be enforced, on suggestion from President Petro Poroshenko.

But what exactly does that mean for the country?

What is martial law?

Martial law can be declared when there is near-violent civil unrest or major natural disasters.

The features of martial law involve:

Curfews

The suspension of civil law, civil rights and habeas corpus (allowing detention of citizens)

The application of military law or military justice to civilians

Civilians defying martial law being subjected to military tribunes (Court Martials)

Although the legal effects of martial law differ depending on where it is issued, it generally involves the suspension of ordinary civil rights.

A state of martial law is temporary in theory, but could continue indefinitely.

It is only carried out when deemed necessary, and only limited by international law and the conventions of civilised warfare.

Civil courts donâ€™t review the decisions of tribunals set up by military authorities, and there is little knowledge on what remedies there are against potential situations involving the military abusing their position of power.

How is martial law being enforced in Ukraine?

After a vote in the Ukrainian parliament, it was decided that martial law would come into place at 9am local time on Wednesday 28 November and run until 27 December.

It will not be for the whole country, but will be implemented in 10 of the 27 regions of Ukraine.

These are: five border regions with Russia, two regions bordering Moldovaâ€™s Tinas-Dniester region and three regions on the Black Sea and Sea of Azov coast.

The Vinnytsia, Luhansk, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Sumy, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Kherson, inland waters of the Azov-Kerch water area, Verkhovna Rada, Donetsk and Zaporizhia regions will all be affected.

Martial law in Ukraine will allow the military to ban any further protests or strikes over Russiaâ€™s actions.

It will also allow the government to call up ordinary citizens for military service or to work on projects in the sake of defence of the country, if they so wish.

A curfew will likely be put in place in the martial law regions, whilst media and political parties will be heavily monitored and possibly restricted.

VOA News quote President Poroshenko as saying: â€˜I hope politicians and the media will act responsibly and appropriately under the current circumstances and will not attack Ukraine with the theses borrowed from Russian propagandists.â€™

Property can be seized for defence purposes or citizensâ€™ homes can be forcibly used to house soldiers. Further possible restrictions are reported here by UNIAN.

19,Canadian FM Freeland Was Slated to Be George Soros' Authorized Biographer â€“ OffGuardian,https://off-guardian.org/2017/09/29/canadian-fm-freeland-was-slated-to-be-george-soros-authorized-biographer/,https://www.unian.info/world/1419457-new-commander-of-canadian-army-has-ukrainian-roots.htm,Paul Wynnyk,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,3/8/2025,off-guardian.org,Canadian FM Freeland Was Slated to Be George Soros' Authorized Biographer,"by John Helmer, via Russia Insider

A Toronto newspaper has revealed that Canadaâ€™s leading Russia hater, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, had a deal with George Soros (lead image) to write his biography after she had lost her journalist jobs at the Financial Times and Reuters, and before she started her run for election to the Canadian parliament.

On August 16 the Toronto Globe and Mail reported Soros is a â€œclose friendâ€ of Freeland, and that with her he has â€œvery great hopes for Canadaâ€. Before she decided to run for parliament, the newspaper says Freeland had a â€œdealâ€ for â€œa sort of authorized biography of George Sorosâ€. Sorosâ€™s spokesman in New York, Laura Silber, refused to answer repeated questions last week for clarification of the terms of this deal or the compensation Soros agreed with Freeland.

Freelandâ€™s first filing to the Canadian parliamentâ€™s ethics watchdog was registered on May 1, 2014. There is no mention of Soros, but there is â€œincome received under a book collaboration agreement with an individualâ€. Freeland refused last week to identify that individual by name.

Freelandâ€™s parliamentary website ran this picture of Soros (left), Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (centre) and Freeland (right) at a World Economic Forum meeting she arranged in Davos in January 2016: https://cfreeland.liberal.ca/news-nouvelles/photos-from-the-davos-world-economic-forum/

In her parliamentary filing on income and assets Freeland also mentions â€œspeaking fees and honorariaâ€ she received for â€œ10th Annual Yalta Meeting, Yalta, Ukraineâ€. Thatâ€™s a roundabout way of reporting that Ukrainian oligarch Victor Pinchukâ€™s eponymous foundation paid Freeland for her participation in the annual conference of his Yalta European Strategy (YES), an expensive lobbying effort to drive Ukrainian membership of the European Union and combat the Russian alternatives. At the conference for which Pinchuk paid Freeland, others on the tab included Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Tony Blair. For more detail on Pinchukâ€™s funding of an anti-Russian lobby effort in the US, and for the source of his funds in a Russian insurance company fraud, read this and this.

Freeland and Pinchuk at YES

Freeland refuses to say how much money she has received from organizations associated with Pinchuk.

She also wonâ€™t explain why in her list of assets, which she is required to file each year with the Canadian parliamentâ€™s Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner, she has omitted to identify the asset she has publicly admitted to owning with her sister, an apartment in Kiev overlooking Maidan Square. This is Freeelandâ€™s disclosure file and here is Freelandâ€™s admission in February 2014 to Macleanâ€™s magazine that she owns an apartment on the Maidan.

In March 2016, according to her parliamentary income and assets reports, Freeland filed what the Ethics Office calls a â€œconfidential reportâ€. The brief mention omits to say what has been kept a state secret, or why, except to conclude that â€œall initial reporting and compliance measures have been taken to comply with the Conflict of Interest Act.â€ Freeland was required to sell her company share portfolio.

Freelandâ€™s concealment of the personal interests she and backers like Soros and Pinchuk share in their pursuit of policy towards Ukraine and Russia has not been investigated by the Canadian press or the parliamentâ€™s conflict of interest commissioner.

The Financial Times management in London proved to be more inquisitive of Freelandâ€™s closeness to the subjects of her reporting. According to the Globe and Mail, she â€œclashed with editor-in-chief Lionel Barberâ€, and was ousted from her post in Europe, removed to New York for what was reported as â€œnot a promotionâ€. Last week Freeland was asked to clarify whether the Financial Times investigation related to possible conflict of interest, and what the outcome was. She wonâ€™t say.

In Canada the Globe and Mail and other newspapers and media networks defend Freeland from the evidence that she has concealed her long family collaboration with the German Army occupation of the Galician region of Poland and Ukraine during World War II, and the familyâ€™s active support of the Galician programme for the liquidation of Poles, Jews and Russians. For more on that story, read this.

The promotion of ethnic cleansing for the installation of a Greater Galicia, centered in Lviv (Lemberg in German, Lvov in Russian) had a bloody history before Michael Chomiak, Freelandâ€™s maternal grandfather, slipped out of Soviet Ukraine in 1939 and volunteered for training and service to the German occupation authorities in Cracow, Poland. Newly read documents of Chomiakâ€™s, including several discovered in Warsaw this year, establish that Chomiak and his family were rewarded by the Germans with apartment, car, and other assets all taken from Jews who were shipped to death camps. So high-ranking in the German programme for Galicia was Chomiak that he was evacuated by the German Army back to Germany in 1945. The Polish intelligence services were still hunting for Chomiak until the 1980s â€“ without knowing he had fled for refuge to an Alberta farm in Canada; that continues to be one of Freelandâ€™s real estate assets today.

The latest Globe & Mail report dismissed this history and Freelandâ€™s refusal to address it, by calling it a Moscow operation to â€œto discredit Ms Freeland by making hay of unpleasant family history about her grandfather serving as editor of a Nazi-controlled newspaper.â€ The Globe and Mail reporter, Adam Radwanski, also comes from the family of a Pole, Piotr Radwanski, a eugenics specialist, who ended up in Baden-Baden, Germany, after the war ended, and then migrated to Montreal.

Freelandâ€™s promotion of her grandfatherâ€™s programme for the military takeover of Ukraine as German, now Canadian policy, is one of several Galician operations in Ottawa. The family of Lieutenant-General Paul Wynnyk, appointed commander of the Canadian Army in July 2016, is from Stryi, 40 kilometres south of Lviv; his familyâ€™s record is â€œtruly inspirationalâ€, according to the Ukrainian-Canadian Congress.

The head of the Canadian Armyâ€™s force in Ukraine, Operation UNIFIER, is Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Lubiniecki, whose family also comes from the Galician region, and who was named to his Galician post in March of this year. The operational headquarters is at Starychi, 40 kilometres northwest of Lviv in an area notorious for its Ukrainian and German killing grounds of Jews and Poles. Lubinieckiâ€™s unit had been restricted to Galicia at the start of its deployment in 2015, but in March of this year Freeland and Wynnyk decided to extend their operational area eastwards. â€œWhile Canadian troops are still required to stay away from the border with Russia and the fighting in eastern Ukraine,â€ Lubiniecki told a Toronto reporter, â€œthe rest of the country is now fair game.â€

Right photo: Lubiniecki (right) with Ukrainian Lieut-General Pavlo Tkachuk (left), Lviv â€“ August 17, 2017. On a visit to the Galician front in July, Wynnyk told the Ukrainian state news agency: â€œwe are also learning from our Ukrainian counterparts based on their recent experiences.â€ Lubiniecki told the Ukrainian media : â€œThatâ€™s what allies do for one another. They share lessons learnedâ€¦ Thatâ€™s certainly what occurs between Ukrainians and Canadians.â€

Another Galician is Canadaâ€™s ambassador to Ukraine, Roman Waschuk. His family comes from Ivano-Frankivsk and Buchach. Waschuk was posted to the Canadian embassy in Kiev in 1994-98, and then appointed ambassador in October 2014. As a youngster in Canada, Waschuk trained as a member of the Galician Plast youth organization.

In mid-August a report on the new evidence on Freeland was commissioned from me by a Canadian politician and former member of the Green Party, Dimitri Lascaris. He doubles as a reporter, interviewer and member of the board of directors of The Real News Network (TRNN), a provincial internet broadcaster in Baltimore, in the US. Lascaris (pictured below left) is supervised by Paul Jay (right), a former Canadian Broadcasting Corporation journalist and now editor in chief of TRNN.



Lascaris recorded a 30-minute interview with me on August 21. At first he delayed its broadcast, claiming he was â€œfact-checkingâ€. Lascaris then claimed that Soros had issued a â€œdefinitive rejectionâ€ of the reported deal with Freeland, and cancelled the broadcast. He and his TRNN colleagues refuse to reveal the email exchange with Soros.

Lascaris added last week that he hasnâ€™t had the time to check with Freeland on her side of the Soros deal, or her Ukrainian sources of income and real estate. His reason, he said, is that â€œboth of my kids are leaving home to go to university and I am moving them into their new accommodations far from our home. I am not going to drop everything and neglect my familyâ€™s needs to respond immediately to your email.â€",9/29/2017 0:00,en,Real

Iran had initially claimed it was â€œobviousâ€ that its military had not shot down the plane.

â€œThe Iranian military did well by downing the passenger plane,â€ Norouzi said in an interview with the Iranian newspaper Hamdeli, according to the U.S.-funded Radio Farda. Norouzi, a member of the Iranian parliamentâ€™s powerful Legal and Judicial Commission, claimed that the military was right to blow up the plane because it had â€œcome under Americaâ€™s control.â€

The lawmaker claimed that the Ukrainian International Airlines (UIA) plane â€“ which its owners insisted had no known technical deficiencies that would cause it to crash â€“ had made a flight to Israel â€œthe week before the incident and appeared to have been tampered with and manipulated, there.â€

â€œGiven the fact that other countries were controlling the plane, our military forces did their job well,â€ Norouzi contended, providing no evidence for the claim that allegedly hostile foreign forces were in control of the plane. The lawmaker also did not explain in any detail what he believed â€œAmericaâ€ was going to do with the plane once under its control, though he did say that it had identified â€œspecial targets in Iran,â€ suggesting a potential act of terrorism.

UIA Flight 752 took off out of Tehran on January 8, 2020, just as the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, began a barrage of ballistic missile launches on Iraqi military bases. Tehran claimed the rockets were retribution against Washington â€“ the Iraqi bases were housing American troops â€“ for an airstrike against Major General Qasem Soleimani, the head of the IRGCâ€™s Quds Force, in Iraq. The Quds Force is the IRGC wing responsible for international acts of terrorism; Soleimani had pioneered the increased use of roadside bombs to dismember American troops during his tenure at the head of the group. At the time of his death, President Donald Trump said that Soleimani had been planning imminent attacks on Americans in Iraq.

The Ukrainian passenger jet exploded shortly after taking off in Tehran. Initially, Iranian officials insisted that mechanical error on the plane caused it to crash, a claim President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed doubt towards.

â€œ[W]hat is obvious to us and we can say for sure is that no missile has hit the plane,â€ Civil Aviation Organization of Iran chief Ali Abedzadeh told reporters at a press conference after the crash. Iranian officials began bulldozing the crash site, destroying all evidence, almost immediately after the incident.

Three days after the crash, and after mounting evidence surfaced that a missile shot the plane out of the sky, the IRGC admitted that it had shot the plane down with anti-aircraft missiles. The Iranian regime immediately applauded the IRGC for its â€œheartwarmingâ€ and â€œhighly praiseworthyâ€ admission of guilt and blamed the â€œcriminal U.S.â€ for inducing the IRGC into killing the nearly 200 civilians.

Iranian officials outside of the IRGC refused to allow the terrorist organization to take responsibility. Iran Guardian Council chairman Ahmad Jannati speculated later in January that the United States had hacked the IRGCâ€™s anti-aircraft missile system to shoot the plane down and embarrass Iran. Other officials claimed that Washington had hacked into the IRGCâ€™s communication system, making it impossible for the commercial plane to confirm that it was not a threat.

â€œThe root of all sorrows goes back to America,â€ Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in the aftermath of the crash.

Iran has yet to return the black boxes to Ukraine, the government where the planeâ€™s owners reside. Tehran spent months refusing to give the black boxes to any government allied with the United States. On March 11, Iranian officials finally agreed to send the black boxes to Ukraine and Canada, the flightâ€™s ultimate destination, but walked back that promise two days later, blaming the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Iran is currently facing one of the worst outbreaks of Chinese coronavirus in the world after lying about its infection rate for weeks. The Iranian Islamic regime currently claims 60,500 cases of Chinese coronavirus nationwide and 3,739 deaths. Yet observers, including some in the Iranian government, have noted that regional death and infection tolls for multiple Iranian provinces add up to a larger number than the federal government total. The National Council of Resistance of Iran (IRGC), the countryâ€™s largest dissident organization, has kept its own death count using informants in the country and has confirmed nearly 20,000 deaths as of Monday.

Zelensky described Nord Stream 2 â€“ a proposed natural gas pipeline that will make the European Union more dependent on Russian fuel while boosting leader Vladimir Putinâ€™s economy â€“ as a â€œweapon in the hands of the Russian Federationâ€ and argued that it was â€œnot very understandableâ€ for the United States not to express concern or attempt to block its allies from allowing Russia greater influence in the West. The remarks were published in English by the Washington-based media outlet Axios, which received an exclusive interview with Zelensky on Sunday.

Under President Donald Trump, routinely maligned by the American left for his alleged friendliness towards Putin, the White House resolutely opposed the construction of Nord Stream 2. Trump sanctioned the company in charge of the project, but Biden recently repealed the sanctions.

â€œTo go ahead and impose sanctions now would, I think, be counterproductive in terms of our European relations,â€ Biden argued in May, referring to Nord Stream 2. â€œThey know how strongly I feel.â€

â€œWell, to be honest, we were very surprised,â€ Zelensky said on Sunday, referring to Bidenâ€™s decision not to stand in the way of the project. â€œIt still seems to me that Nord Stream 2 â€¦ we understand that this is a weapon, a real weapon, and I speak openly about it.â€

â€œA weapon in the hands of the Russian Federation, and it is not very understandable, I feel, and definitely not expected, that the bullets to this weapon can possibly be provided by such a great country as the United States,â€ Zelensky continued, â€œBecause it is an exemplary civilization, an exemplary democracy in the world.â€

Zelensky repeatedly described himself as â€œsurprisedâ€ by the decision and claimed that the Biden administration had reached out to Kyiv suggesting it would attempt to prevent the project from going forward, suggesting Biden deliberately misled him.

â€œYou know, we had this first conversation with President Biden, it was a phone conversation, and I received all the signals. They were direct signals, and I was very happy about it,â€ Zelensky said. â€œBiden knows Ukraine better than any other previous, former President, and therefore he understands all the issues, and, whatâ€™s most important, all the security risks. That is why, again, we were very unpleasantly surprised.â€

While suggesting to Zelenskyâ€™s administration behind closed doors that the White House would intervene, the Ukrainian president said the Biden administration did not have the courtesy to tell Kyiv it would not challenge Nord Stream 2: â€œI found out about it, probably, like everybody else, from the briefing.â€

Zelensky rejected the logic Nord Stream 2 was too far along for American sanctions on it to make sense. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told reporters on Sunday that Moscow expects the construction of Nord Stream 2 â€“ which is expected to fuel European Union allies of the United States, most prominently Germany â€“ to be done by the end of the year. It will allow Russia to bypass Ukraine, which sits in between the natural gasâ€™s origin and intended destination, potentially devastating Kyivâ€™s economy.

â€œNord Stream 2 is financed by leading energy companies from France, Germany, the Netherlands, Great Britain and Austria,â€ the projectâ€™s official website claims. â€œA multi-billion Euro investment in European industry and services, the project involves more than 200 companies from 17 countries worldwide.â€

â€œI believe that even if there was only one percent left, it would still be possible to stop such a serious leverage that Russia will have in the future to influence energy security and Europe in general, including Ukraine,â€ the president argued. â€œEven if there was only one percent left, it just needs to be done. Moreover, everything is now in the US Presidentâ€™s hands only, and I am sure that he is aware of that, and his team is aware of that, they know that.â€

Zelensky also challenged Biden administration concerns that the American diplomatic relationship with Germany, one of Nord Stream 2â€™s biggest beneficiaries, was worth not standing in the way of Russian influence.

â€œI understand that the relationship between the United States and Germany is very important. I wouldnâ€™t want to intervene between these two esteemed countries. However, how many Ukrainian lives does the relationship between the United States and Germany cost?â€ Zelensky asked.

Ukraine and Russia are currently at war in the eastern regions of the former country, known collectively as Donbass. The Putin regime claims to have no involvement in the Donbass war, instead blaming local pro-Russian rebels with no official ties to Russia. Zelensky, along with his predecessors, have repeatedly blamed Moscow for hostilities there directly. As of 2019, the latest date for when statistics are available, over 13,000 people have died in the Donbass conflict since it began in 2014.

Biden has held phone conversations with Putin twice as many times as with Zelensky and is tentatively scheduled to meet Putin in person on June 16. He has not scheduled any in-person meetings with Zelensky, though the Ukrainian president told Axios he hopes to plan such a meeting before June 16. Axios separately reported that the Biden team has no interest in such a meeting, citing anonymous individuals.

Zelensky told the outlet that Bidenâ€™s outsized attention to Putin over himself, who leads a U.S.-allied control, tells the world that Biden sees the world as a two-tiered system: â€œthere are the great powers of the world, and there is everybody else.â€

Asked for his feelings on the matter, Zelensky said his â€œangerâ€ at Biden had subsided, leaving only â€œdisappointment.â€

Elsewhere in the interview, Zelensky compared Biden to basketball legend Michael Jordan and expressed optimism that the Washington-Kyiv relationship would survive: â€œItâ€™s like, written on your money. â€˜We trust in God.'â€

The European Court of Human Rights has found the Ukrainian government guilty of committing human rights violations during the May 2, 2014 Odessa massacre, in which dozens of Russian-speaking demonstrators were forced into the cityâ€™s Trade Unions House and burned alive by ultranationalist thugs.

Citing the â€œrelevant authoritiesâ€™ failure to do everything that could reasonably be expected of them to prevent the violence in Odessa,â€ the court ruled unanimously that Ukraine violated Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to life. The judges also condemned the Ukrainian governmentâ€™s failure â€œto stop that violence after its outbreak, to ensure timely rescue measures for people trapped in the fire, and to institute and conduct an effective investigation into the events.â€

42 people were killed as a result of the fire, a bloody bookend to the so-called â€œMaidan revolutionâ€ that saw Ukraineâ€™s democratically-elected president deposed in a Western-backed coup in 2014. Ukrainian officials and legacy media outlets have consistently framed the deaths as a tragic accident, with some figures even blaming anti-Maidan protesters themselves for starting the blaze. That notion is thoroughly discredited by the verdict, which was delivered by a team of seven judges including a Ukrainian justice.

As dozens of anti-Maidan activists burned to death, the ECHR found deployment of fire engines to the site was â€œdeliberately delayed for 40 minutes,â€ even though the local fire station was just one kilometer away.

In the end, the judicial body determined there was nothing which indicated Ukrainian authorities â€œhad done everything that could reasonably be expected of them to avertâ€ the violence. Officials in Kiev, they said, made â€œno efforts whatsoeverâ€ to prevent skirmishes between pro- and anti-Maidan activists that led to the deadly inferno, despite knowing in advance such clashes were likely to break out. Their â€œnegligenceâ€¦ went beyond an error of judgment or carelessness.â€

The case was brought by 25 people who lost family members in the Neo-Nazi arson attack and clashes that preceded it, and three who survived the fire with various injuries. Though the ECHR found Ukraine violated their human rights, the court demanded Ukraine pay them just 15,000 euros each in damages.

The ruling also stopped short of acknowledging the full reality of the Odessa slaughter, as it largely overlooked the role played by Western-supported neo-Nazi elements and their intimate ties to the sniper massacre in February 2014 in Maidan Square which has been conclusively determined to have been a false flag. In the judgesâ€™ decision, they downplayed or justified violence by the violent Ukrainian football fans and skinheads, charitably describing them as â€œpro-unity activists.â€

Russians burned alive while Ukrainian officials looked away

Ukraineâ€™s Maidan protests commenced in November 2013 after President Yanukovych declined to form a trade agreement with Europe and renewed dialogue with Russia, and tensions quickly began to escalate between Odessaâ€™s sizable Russian-speaking population and Ukrainian nationalists. As the ECHR ruling noted, â€œwhile violent incidents had overall remained rareâ€¦ the situation was volatile and implied a constant risk of escalation.â€ In March 2014, anti-Maidan activists set up a tent camp in Kulykove Pole Square, and began calling for a referendum on the establishment of an â€œOdessa Autonomous Republic.â€

The next month, supporters of Odesa Chornomorets and Kharkiv Metalist football clubs announced a rally â€œFor a United Ukraineâ€ on May 2. According to the ECHR, thatâ€™s when â€œanti-Maidan posts began to appear on social media describing the event as a Nazi march and calling for people to prevent it.â€ Though the European court branded the description Russian â€œdisinformation,â€ thereâ€™s extensive evidence that hooligans associated with both clubs had overt Neo-Nazi sympathies and associations, and well-established reputations for violence. The football clubs involved later went on to form the notorious Azov Battalion.

Fearing their tent encampment would be attacked, anti-Maidan activists resolved to disrupt the â€œpro-unityâ€ march before it reached them. The ECHR revealed Ukraineâ€™s security services and cybercrime unit had substantive intelligence indicating â€œviolence, clashes and disorderâ€ were certain on the day. However, authorities â€œignored the available intelligence and the relevant warning signs,â€ and failed to take the â€œproper measuresâ€ to â€œstamp out any provocation.â€

On May 2, 2014, anti-Nazi activists confronted the demonstrators as the march began, and violent clashes immediately erupted. At roughly 5:45 PM, in the precise manner of the Maidan Square sniper false flag massacre three months earlier, multiple anti-Maidan activists were fatally shot â€œby someone standing on a nearby balconyâ€ using â€œa hunting gun,â€ the ruling states. Subsequently, â€œpro-unity protestersâ€¦ gained the upper hand in the clashes,â€ and charged towards Kulykove Pole square.

Anti-Maidan activists took refuge in the Trade Unions House, a five-story building overlooking the square, while their ultranationalist adversaries â€œstarted setting fire to the tents,â€ according to the ruling. Gunfire and Molotov cocktails were exchanged by both sides, and before long, the building was ablaze. â€œNumerous callsâ€ were made to the local fire brigade, including by police, â€œto no avail.â€ The court noted that the fire chief had â€œinstructed his staff not to send any fire engines to Kulykove Pole without his explicit order,â€ so none were dispatched.

Many of those trapped in the building died when attempting to escape by jumping from its upper windows, and those that survived were treated to more â€˜unityâ€™ by the violent demonstrators outside. â€œVideo footage shows pro-unity protesters attacking people who had jumped or had fallen,â€ the ECHR notes. It was not until 8:30 PM that firefighters finally entered the building and extinguished the blaze. Police then arrested 63 surviving activists they found remaining in the building or on the roof. Those detained werenâ€™t released until two days later, when a several hundred-strong group of anti-Maidan protesters stormed the police station holding them.

The litany of security failures and industrial scale negligence by authorities that day was greatly aggravated by â€œlocal prosecutors, law enforcement, and military officersâ€ not being â€œcontactable for a large part or all of [the] time,â€ as they were coincidentally attending a meeting with Ukraineâ€™s Deputy Prosecutor General. The ECHR â€œfound the attitude and passivity of those officials inexplicableâ€ â€“ apparently unwilling to consider the obvious possibility that Ukrainian authorities purposefully made themselves incommunicado to ensure maximum mayhem and bloodshed, while insulating themselves from legal repercussions.

Because Ukrainian authorities â€œhad not done everything they reasonably could to prevent the violence,â€ nor even â€œwhat could reasonably be expected of them to save peopleâ€™s lives,â€ the ECHR found Kiev violated Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court also concluded authorities â€œfailed to institute and conduct an effective investigation into the events in Odessa,â€ a violation of the â€œprocedural aspectâ€ of Article 2.

Anatomy of a Kiev coverup

Though left unstated, the ECHRâ€™s appraisal of the Odessa massacre, and the officials who failed in their most basic duties points to a deliberate state-level coverup.

For example, no effort was made to seal off â€œaffected areas of the city centreâ€ in the eventâ€™s aftermath. Instead, â€œthe first thingâ€ local authorities did â€œwas to send cleaning and maintenance services to those areas,â€ meaning invaluable evidence was almost inevitably eradicated.

Unsurprisingly, when on-site inspections were finally carried out two weeks later, the probes â€œproduced no meaningful results,â€ the ECHR noted. The Trade Unions House likewise â€œremained freely accessible to the public for 17 days after the events,â€ giving malicious actors plentiful time to manipulate, remove, or plant incriminating evidence at the site. Meanwhile, â€œmany of the suspects absconded,â€ the court noted. Several criminal investigations were opened, only to go nowhere, left to expire under Ukraineâ€™s statute of limitations.

Other cases that reached trial â€œremained pending for years,â€ before being dropped, despite â€œextensive photographic and video evidence regarding both the clashes in the city centre and the fire,â€ from which culpritsâ€™ identities could be easily discerned. The ECHR expressed no confidence that Ukrainian authorities â€œmade genuine efforts to identify all the perpetrators,â€ and several forensic reports werenâ€™t released for many years, in breach of basic protocols. Elsewhere, the Court noted a criminal investigation of an individual suspected of having shot at anti-Maidan activists was inexplicably discontinued on four separate occasions, on identical grounds.

The court also noted â€œserious defectsâ€ in investigations into Ukrainian officialsâ€™ role in the massacre. Primarily, this took the form of â€œprohibitive delaysâ€ and â€œsignificant periods of unexplained inactivity and stagnationâ€ in opening cases. For instance, â€œalthough it had never been disputed that the fire service regional head had been responsible for the delayed deployment of fire engines to Kulykove Pole,â€ it took nearly two years for the Ukrainian government to officially investigate.

Similarly, Odessaâ€™s regional police chief not only failed to implement any â€œcontingency plan in the event of mass disorder,â€ as required, but internal documents claiming that security measures had in fact been undertaken were found to have been forged. A criminal investigation into the chief took nearly a year to materialize, then remained pending â€œfor about eight years,â€ when it was closed after the statute of limitations expired.

The Georgian connection

The notion that the incineration of anti-Maidan activists in May 2014 was an intentional and premeditated act of mass murder, conceived and directed by Kievâ€™s US-installed far-right government, was apparently not considered by the ECHR. But testimonies from a Ukrainian parliamentary commission which was instituted in the massacreâ€™s immediate aftermath indicate the violence was not a freak twist of fate spontaneously produced by two hostile factions clashing in Odessa, as the ruling suggests.

That parliamentary commission found Ukrainian national and regional officials explicitly planned to use far-right activists drawn from the fascist Maidan Self-Defence to violently suppress Odessaâ€™s would-be separatists, and disperse all those camped by the Trade Unions House. Moreover, the notorious ultra-nationalist Ukrainian politician Andriy Parubiy and 500 of its armed members of Maidan Self-Defense were dispatched to the city from Kiev on the eve of the massacre.

From 1998 â€“ 2004, Parubiy served as founder and leader of Neo-Nazi paramilitary faction Patriot of Ukraine. He also headed Kievâ€™s National Security and Defence Council at the time of the Odessa massacre. Ukraineâ€™s State Bureau of Investigations immediately began scrutinizing Parubiyâ€™s role in the May 2014 events after he was replaced as lead parliamentary speaker, following the countryâ€™s 2019 general election. This probe has seemingly come to nothing since, although a year prior a Georgian militant testified to Israeli documentarians that he engaged in â€œprovocationsâ€ in the Odessa massacre under the command of Parubiy, who told him to attack anti-Maidan activists and â€œburn everything.â€

That militant was one of several Georgian fighters who has admitted they were personally responsible for the February 2014 Maidan Square false flag sniper massacre, under the command of ultranationalist Ukrainian figures like Parubiy, and Mikhael Saakashvili, the founder of infamous mercenary brigade Georgian Legion.

Putin lamented that, thanks to Soviet planners failing to follow divide the Union by where ethnic groups actually lived, Russia now contends with thousands of â€œsort pointsâ€ of ethnic tension that require a delicate hand to diffuse.

Ukrainian officials objected to Putinâ€™s comments, particularly in the context of Putin illegally annexing part of Ukraine in 2014 and currently engaging in an ongoing invasion of Ukraineâ€™s eastern Donbas region. Russia claims those attempting to carve an ethnic Russian state out of Donbas are independent â€œrebels,â€ not Russians, and any Russia participating in the civil war is a â€œvolunteerâ€ with no ties to the Russian government.

Putin has traditionally held a multi-hour press conference in anticipation of the Christmas holiday where he answers questions on a variety of domestic and international affairs.

The Russian news agency TASS did not specify why Putin was discussing 20th-century Soviet history. The longtime head of government reportedly lamented the inefficiency of Soviet planning and ethnic tensions he blamed on poor choices made by Lenin himself

â€œBy his [Leninâ€™s] decisions, ethnic groups were tied to concrete territories, and then they got the right to secede from the Soviet Union. But even the territories had been carved up in such a way that they did not always correspond and still donâ€™t coincide now with the traditional places of domicile of any given ethnicity,â€ Putin said. â€œSore points sprung up right away, and they are still in place in relations between the former Soviet republics. Moreover, there are 2,000 such points inside the Russian Federation.â€

Putin then turned to Ukraine, which he said benefitted territorially by inheriting â€œRussianâ€ territory.

â€œWe have just discussed with my Ukrainian colleague our relations, but when the Soviet Union was being set up, the original, ancestral Russian territories, which had never had anything to do with Ukraine â€” the entire Black Sea region, Russiaâ€™s western lands â€” went to Ukraine with a strange wording â€˜to increase the percentage ratio of the proletariat in Ukraineâ€™,â€ Putin alleged. â€œThis was a somewhat bizarre decision, but this did happen. All this is the legacy of Vladimir Ilyich Leninâ€™s state building and we have to grapple with this now.â€

Of the territories that Putin already controls, he warned, â€œif you let things go for even a second, there will be hell to pay.â€

Putinâ€™s criticism of Lenin did not go as far as to support efforts to exhume him, which apparently also came up at the press conference.

â€œAs for [Leninâ€™s] body, I believe it should be left as it is, at least as long as there are those, and there are quite a few people here who link their lives, their fates as well as certain achievements of the past, the achievements of the Soviet era with that,â€ TASS quoted Putin as saying. The news agency did not offer any context as to what the comment was a response to.

Ukraineâ€™s Foreign Affairs Ministry rapidly dismissed Putinâ€™s claims that much of Ukraine is originally Russian.

â€œWe condemn any attempts by the Russian Federation to encroach on the territorial integrity of Ukraine,â€ Deputy Foreign Minister Vasyl Bodnarhe said on Friday, making the reverse claim that much of what exists currently in Russian borders should belong to Ukraine. â€œLetâ€™s turn to history: who belonged to whom? Once upon a time, Moscow was subordinated to Kyiv, so letâ€™s talk about the roots, not what grew after.â€

Former Ukrainian Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC) Oleksandr Turchynov went further, contending that most of modern Russia should not be governed out of Moscow.

â€œIf we separate from Russia those territories that were annexed by blood, violence, betrayal and lies, the â€˜originally Russianâ€™ swamps remaining after that could easily fit within one Moscow region,â€ he said.

Russia is currently embroiled in a civil war to strip Kyiv of control of Donetsk and Luhansk, the two provinces of the Donbas region, both of whom contain violent insurrections declaring each a sovereign Russian republic. Putin has claimed not to have a direct hand in the violent pro-Russian gangs of the Donbas but has regularly equipped them with supplies, sending a 96th Russian â€œhumanitarian aidâ€ convoy into the Donbas on Friday, over loud Ukrainian objections. Russia claims the convoy contains â€œChristmas gifts,â€ which Ukrainian officials have expressed doubt about.

The Ukrainian government argues that Putin is attempting to annex Donbas the same way he did the Crimean Peninsula, which belonged to Ukraine until Russia invaded it in 2014. To ease tensions in Donbas, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Putin in Paris last month, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron as intermediaries. Putin claimed he was â€œhappyâ€ with the results of the talks, while Zelensky lamented the affair as frustrating and useless, calling Putin a â€œdifficultâ€ person to negotiate with.
